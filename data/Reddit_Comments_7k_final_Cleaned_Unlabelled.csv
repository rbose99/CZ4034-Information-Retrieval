Regarding value, few concepts.
1) something is only worth what another is willing to pay for it
2) people view nfts as pixels on a screen, can also draw parallels to art being just oil on a canvas
3) similarly you can get replicas of paintings, statues, etc. but theres only one mona lisa and only one michaelangelos david.
