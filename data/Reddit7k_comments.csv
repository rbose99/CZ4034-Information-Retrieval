With NFT ownership all rights holders get paid on transfers. It's the fucking opposite of your position and any company will want to enter a market they had no way of accessing prior, that's just simple business logic. Probably not your field of expertise given your recent rhetoric. 

More rights for digital owners are coming, everyone that has done some simple research can see the writing on the wall. Those that can't see it can remain poor/forgotten/left behind because of their lack of understanding and stubbornness to adapt.

Reddit_Comments,Zaofy,"I can't in CSGO, although there have been more than a few times when people just sold the stuff for irl money. And again: Why use NFTs? If Valve wants to fascilitate the sale of skins for real money without going via Steam Wallet they could already easily do so. Bit of a bit bad example here because Valve also owns Steam, but the same would go for a game like GTA. Nothing is really gained by fascilitating it via an NFT instead of a database entry. If the developer wants to make the item unusable they can easily do that either way.

Depends on the ticket. One of my local cinemas offers a kind of movie pass where I can pay a subscription and watch two movies each month ""for free"". Admittedly that one isn't transferable to another person. But transferable season tickets have been a thing for ages in sports.

But I'm not sure what your question is getting at? Would an NFT change that? It's still the cinema that decides what happens with your ticket. If they decide to void your ""forever ticket"" they can do so.

Reddit_Comments,PerfectZeong,"You don't have to fake the nike nft you just have to sell a fake shoe with the legit nft.

They have to do all the physical inventory management they do right now and also make sure that physical inventory stays current with a digital inventory that has to match the physical. 

And this is not to say that Nike won't eventually do something like this because the buzzword is popular but it's not going to meaningfully fight repros except in a few edge cases. The discount shoes I buy in china town, well I know they're fakes, that's why I'm buying them.

Well my question to you is how many passports are faked per year and how much passport fraud happens that an nft can't get around?

Reddit_Comments,medforddad,"Yeah, an NFT is basically just a unique ID that can be transferred between people securely on a public ledger. If you prove to a game company that you're the current owner of that ID, they can render a special sword (or whatever) for your character in game.

But nothing about the NFT contract forces them to do so. You still need their cooperation to do the thing in-game that they said they'd do. If, say, you later violated their T.O.S., they could punish you by by not rendering any of your character's special digital things. They could maintain a blacklist of NFTs to not render, so even if you transferred it to someone else, it wouldn't render.

I get all that. I'm just saying that at the very least NFTs could make the secondary market as little fairer, easier, less controlled by a single party.",144,i2pg54m,t1_i2nvamt,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2pg54m/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,JaCraig,"I agree that it was nice to have a civil conversation on the subject.

I did forget one positive for NFTs and a company that has made it kind of work: Konami. They did manage $162k in sales but I haven't seen any data for resale. You may want to research that one more. But that one makes sense considering the markets they're popular in.

Reddit_Comments,Zaofy,"That would be a possibility. However: Why would the company use an NFT and not just a regular database?

Carrying over things from different games isn't something new. RPGs have been doing it for ages now (ie carrying over saves from one entry to the next like the Bioware games, or even items received like in the Witcher) Unless people actually care that it has a certain unique code attatched I don't see any advantage of using an NFT there.

Reddit_Comments,Hard_Corsair,"&gt;	NFTs have no value in part because they don‚Äôt involve the transfer of any actual ownership in the copyright and they can essentially be reproduced by anyone without limitation unless the copyright holder spends the time and money necessary to protect the copyright.

But that's how basically all media works. If you buy Shrek 2 on DVD, you don't receive any actual ownership or the copyright. You still have people pirating Shrek 2 by torrent. If you pay me $1000 to photograph your wedding you don't own a single photo. If you commission a custom painting you won't own the painting. The creator always retains copyright. That has nothing to do with NFT's unless you somehow mistakenly thought they'd let you completely disregard copyright law. NFT's let you own things, but ""own"" is a very murky term with any media, physical or otherwise.

Essentially, an NFT in the context of artwork is essentially a signature from the creator. It's like buying a book that's been signed by the author; the content is the same but it makes it slightly special. I wouldn't pay large sums of money for a signed book but that doesn't make the concept abominable. But NFT's aren't limited to artwork; they're potentially an extremely broad category. The term itself is easier explained as crypto not-currency. There's a lot of things that aren't currency.

NFT's for gaming in this case can be anything from a cosmetic item like a digital hat to a functional item like a Yu-Gi-Oh card to a proof-of-purchase key that allows you to launch the game.

&gt;	Basically the only value that comes from an nft or a steam marketplace item is in its actual use, not its ownership.

Or the sentiment it generates. People aren't perfectly rational with their purchasing habits and will buy worthless things purely because it amuses them in the moment.

I find it insane that with a name that's as on the nose as ""Bored Ape Yacht Club"" that the whole point is for wealthy morons to burn money for their amusement. It's the ""I'm Rich"" app all over again, but everyone either thinks it's a gold rush or a terrible scam, and neither are right. Paying a ridiculous sum for your iPhone to proclaim that you're rich was never a scam. It was an extreme expense for a 2/10 joke, but that's okay.",389,i2oz249,t1_i2oiiv9,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2oz249/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0
Reddit_Comments,Much_Job3838,"I've always assumed the premise is that the NFT is tied to the game so that the item is ""generated"" from the NFT. 

How I've understood it: The company would mint their items themselves, so it wouldn't be that things appear from nowhere, but say they want to sell a new game. Thus putting up their game and when people press the buy button it goes to a wallet which then allows for owning a copy of the game. 

You can then send it to another wallet if you want to, or keep it, or whatever your will is.

But yes, the skins would have to be implemented for many games and that doesn't really exist today.

So why would Steam for example implement new avatars that can only be purchased over some other marketplace into their platform? If they wanted things to be sellable, they could easily do that already. Same with Fortnite, World of Warcraft, etc.

The only way I could see another plattform implement this is with smart contracts that take a percentage off of every sale. Or if the company banks on getting a large enough windfall from the initial sale (re: Konami and Castlevania). And if they wanted to that they could just use their own database and wouldn't have to ""mint"" them on a specific blockchain.

But again, there is no system in place to ensure consistency and affordability

The main issue here is that NFT's hold no other value than its hype value, they don't even have a use.

That's why the NFT market is so insanely volatile

But people invested in NFT's just aren't willing to listen because all they see is that one NFT that happemed to sell for a million bucks by a freak coincidence and their eyes turn to $ signs and they don't care about anything else, everything tgey say is just an excuse to justify a clearly bad, risky financial decision.

They don't even understwnd what they are and how the system should work, they claim ""its decentralized, its decentralized"" as if that is some sort of good thing but yhen 5 minutes later they whine that they can't get any utility from them.

Yeah well no shit, utility is a feature of a centralized system, not a decentralized one, the second you try to add ""utility"" to it yiu are essentially centralizing it.

The only reason why I can take my country's currency anywhere here and use it is because its backed by a main central system, if I were to take crypto or NFT's and try to buy groceries they'd tell me to pound sand lol

As someone that bought into GME, I do believe in the potential. The revenue is accelerating and in boomer terms: it has beat street estimates the last two quarters. This leads to the question of why did spending greatly outpace revenue to give such an alarming EPS?

The company is obviously doing a turn around. Hiring new leaders to help drive this change, we‚Äôve seen some things happen.
Revamping of the digital platforms (e-commerce), increasing the variety of offerings (broadening the consumer goods market while streamlining the logistics to get the product to customer), and launching an NFT marketplace (exploration of potentially culture changing technology that can grow revenue with great potential). 

I remember looking at the Q3 revenue and thinking that had they just cut spending by a small degree rather than drive for change, the EPS would‚Äôve been at least a positive 0.90 for the quarter (basically on brick/mortar and e-commerce sales alone). 

There‚Äôs a good deal of other reasons that suggest to me that the company is looking into the long term growth with proper infrastructure to support it.

Reddit_Comments,Rumbleinthejungle8,"&gt;What GME is proposing is letting you own an NFT within a game. So they could release a skin on, say, Fortnite where there are only 100 of them in existence. You now own this skin and if you ever want to sell it you can. So instead of spending a couple of bucks on a skin where you will never see your money again, GME creates a marketplace where you can treat the skin like an investment where you can sell it off when you no longer want it.

Gamestop can't do shit to implement this. This has to be implemented on the game's side, in this case Fortnite. And there is 0 reason why game studios would want to share revenue with Gamestop for no reason. 

What value would Gamestop even provide? The coding has to happen on the game's side, so just an interface on a website?

Reddit_Comments,jakdaniels22,"Correct.  If NFTs are to be used in a game then those will be minted(created) by the developers.  So if the developers or publisher do not want NFTs in their game they can make that choice and likely some will do so.

However if they do chose to mint NFTs for their game then depending on the marketplace it is possible that they can receive a percentage of each time it is sold.  The NFT can be skins or even the digital copy of the game itself.  I imagine that to encourage adoption of NFTs into games that an NFT Marketplace like what GameStop is planning would give the developer/publisher a cut of sales but we do not know yet what it will look like for certain.  This can be a win/win with gamers getting ownership of their purchases and developers/publishers getting continued revenue from each sale and resale of their NFTs.

NFTs can replace microtransactions but then you will have true ownership of those assets and can resell them which means they will still have value after you purchase.  So I do not see huge changes to the type of NFTs/microtransaction we will see in games when they are first introduced.

I image developers testing gamers reception to NFTs with new IPs before trying to introduce them to existing IPs risking backlash.  I am excited to see where this takes gaming but it will take gamers voting with their wallets to let them know how we want them integrated to our games.  There is a lot of potential here to be explored.",268,i2noldl,t1_i2ndm4z,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2noldl/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0
Reddit_Comments,bigwetpoops,"Yeah, see, I'm not this stereotype you seem to think I am.  Your weird attempts at making personal attacks are weird.  And serialization is more useful in an encrypted blockchain format than written on the back of a box.  It's a method to make an otherwise copyable asset unique.  Is it useful if you're talking about a jpeg you can screenshot?  Not really.  Is it useful to identify a unique copy of a digital game, allowing an owner to resell it as they would a hard copy?  Uh, yeah.  Buying digital mokey drawing = dumb.  Buying ""used"" copy of an old game = normal.  We should have rights to our digital lives like we do our physical ones.  They're one and the same.

Reddit_Comments,BaxxB_,"I think, if you‚Äôve been seeing the majority of info about it on Reddit, most of your knowledge of NFT‚Äôs is possibly really skewed, and almost certainly incomplete. It‚Äôs easy to say pictures on the internet costing money is silly, because it is. Some would say there‚Äôs money laundering involved in that, and there almost certainly is. But the information that‚Äôs commonly left out, is that the concept of an NFT isn‚Äôt encompassed by just pictures, it‚Äôs simply the one that has been most common. 

Technology is evolving. There are so many possibilities in the digital ownership of an item. In time it will be very common to register physical items as NFT‚Äôs. But can you imagine having one marketplace to make any purchase for all of your digital games and media? For your PC, your console, your VR headset, your handheld? Now imagine that all of those titles are transferred to you by means of NFT, allowing you sole ownership? That means that when you get tired or bored of a game, you don‚Äôt have to uninstall it or just let it sit unplayed forevermore, you can just sell it to someone else, on the same marketplace you bought it! Not to mention, you can buy it from someone else in the first place. Meaning that over time, the users will control the marketplace. 

Yes, there will be special games released and only 10 people allowed to buy it, which will rise and price and become an absurd cultural fixation to certain groups, but that‚Äôs unavoidable. What is avoidable, is letting our imaginations be turned away from the possibilities of new technology!",273,i2nilo8,t1_i2nfx99,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2nilo8/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,JaCraig,"GameStop has existed since 1984, not one year. They've had that whole time to build a decent PC sales platform. As far as consoles, they already can and do sell digital keys. They can also sell Steam, etc. keys. Humble Bundle does that. That part is fine and will keep them in business assuming they don't mess it up.

The issue is this: They have zero ability to allow the games that they sell to be resold because the way the industry works. Microsoft, Sony, Steam, Nintendo, etc. would need to allow it and thus far Steam has said they won't and Sony also seems uninterested. MS is the only one who said they were going to look into 3rd party stores. That leaves them as the backbone for micro transactions which is already becoming a crowded market for vendors but not many takers from the publishers other than Ubisoft who is going it alone. So that means they have to fund devs to use their platform, but recouping the investment seems unlikely to offset the gradual decline of their physical game sales.

So let's be positive for a second and assume that the EU law passes that forces Apple, etc. to allow secondary marketplaces. That gives them an opening where they can be on enough platforms that their business model for this product is viable. But then they still have to deliver which is not 100% a sure thing. They've given zero details and I worked with enough people in the industry to know that people won't be clamoring to join them.

GameStop is like Circuit City. Tons of lead time and nothing to show for it. They could have built a monthly sub service, gone PC, gone heavy into mobile, etc. Those are now saturated. Building out a PC marketplace would require them to go the Epic route which has been a multi year loss thus far with a break even maybe in 1 to 5 years. Build a sub service like Sony, MS, Humble Bundle, etc.? Too many in that space now for a significant share. Oh and I didn't mention VR because it's not leaving the niche market that it is any time soon. Too much space needed and not enough users who would buy in. That leaves mobile.

Mobile is fickle and trying to bet on winners there is tough over the long term. So they'll bet on tons of small devs. Become the microtransaction backbone. That's the only viable business that I see where they can make NFT work and I still don't see it working the way they'd want. But the idea that they'll be able to convince the rest of the industry to change so they can take a cut is not happening without some major intervention.",461,i2nfx99,t1_i2mk2mr,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2nfx99/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,CreativeGPX,"&gt;  A paper contract isn't the same, it can be destroyed, faked, copied etc much more easily than Blockchain.

Sure if you consider the most poorly made paper contract with the most idealistically run NFT. But in reality, the means to protect a paper contract are pretty trivial and have existed for a long time. It doesn't have to be a realistic concern that a contract will be destroyed, faked, copied, etc.

Also, these all have parallels with NFTs. A ""faked"" contract is the same thing as a ""faked"" NFT. You cannot on the blockchain verify that off the blockchain all the proper checks of the people, laws and property were don't, so you're still relying on the same central authorities to do that as if you weren't on the blockchain. Additionally, protecting digital keys is something that is much harder for the average person to do than securing a physical contract. NFTs can be irreversibly stolen if a person gets a virus, falls for a phishing scam, has their key compromised, loses their key, etc. You say that a contract can be lost, but so can a key. The made difference is that problems on the blockchain are, by design, extremely difficult to resolve. Problems not on the blockchain have lots of established methods of resolution.

&gt; Why wouldn't courts help you if you had proof of ownership via recorded history on a Blockchain rather than, say, on paper?

I didn't say they wouldn't help you. I said best case scenario, you'd still ultimately be relying on the courts so it's not an improvement to go on the blockchain.

However, in practice, it might not be valid. If you're not calling a lawyer every time you do an NFT transaction, confirming they the person selling the NFT even has the rights to the thing the NFT mentions, identifying without a doubt who they are in case of fraud, etc., then legally it's a lot riskier. And most proponents of NFTs are touting specifically how it's a feature that you no longer have to interact with all of the institutions that do those things.

&gt; This just isn't true.

That's not a useful argument.

Reddit_Comments,Gizogin,"What the technology is currently used for is bad. What it was intended to be used for is *terrible*. The people behind Ethereum wanted a distributed, trustless, immutable ledger of basically everything, from financial transactions to contracts to medical records. The idea of putting all this personal information in one place, let alone a publicly-visible, trustless environment, is so amazingly bad that it's almost impressive.

Even the lauded ""smart contract"" functionality of NFTs is far less impressive than advocates would like to pretend. 

Every transaction other than reading data off the chain is a transaction that must be verified, and that takes time, energy, and money. 

Individual tokens are tiny, able to hold maybe a few dozen lines of code, and trying to build anything complicated enough to be worth calling a program means you're eating into that limited space even more just because you have to make each chunk of code connect to every other chunk. 

To debug a program, you can't just edit a token; they're basically immutable once minted. Instead, you have to mint a bunch of new tokens and jump through hoops to fix all the references that are pointing to the bugged parts so they instead point to the fixed versions, and every step of that process costs money and takes ages while you wait for all the transactions to be validated.

Reddit_Comments,ampers_and_,"Hello,

The potential of NFTs beyond their current awful status is pretty astounding.

Right now, through glimpses of the data I reviewed coming from the API of GameStop's NFT Marketplace, I see some in-game skins that are being developed. The idea is that through making them non-fungible tokens (NFTs), users will be able to resell the skins or upload them to other games/media that have systems that can access the Blockchain.

This gives companies the opportunity to also return a percentage of the resale where they wouldn't have otherwise when people stop playing their game, or a small fee to transfer the skin to another game.

There is also ideas surrounding the online game resale/transfer system which would allow people who purchase games online to sell them back for most (maybe 90%?) their money, but netting the marketplace and publisher a percentage (5% each?). Currently when you buy a game online, it stays on your account forever.

There is other use cases as well, like trying a NFT to a physical product which could be used for tracking and to make sure you're getting the original product you purchased (could combat the fake products we see flood the market like with Amazon). Or to help prevent people who buy all of a product on release and then resell it for higher prices to people who really want one (like with PS and Xbox).

Overall, the goal of the marketplace as it stands is to be both a central hub for other NFT marketplaces to connect to and trade through (whether it's art NFTs or NFTs connected to video games) as well as a online NFT retailer itself (where people can sell their own art NFT or apply to sell their video game NFT content in collections as well).

I think if it is done properly, can put a lot of ownership back into the consumer. I want to be able to resell my 50 Steam games that I haven't touched in 5 years. I want to actually own a in-game skin and maybe make some money back if I decide to stop playing League or other games. And ultimately, it could be beneficial for publishers and game companies to incorporate it into their system as they would make a percentage off of it.",376,i2m5syp,t1_i2kpppx,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2m5syp/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0
Reddit_Comments,atlas_eater,"I‚Äôm still learning about this and one of the things I found useful was to know precisely what fungible means : 

fungible
f≈≠n‚Ä≤j…ô-b…ôl

Returnable or negotiable in kind or by substitution, as a quantity of grain for an equal amount of the same kind of grain.
Interchangeable.
Able to be substituted for something of equalvalue or utility; interchangeable, exchangeable, replaceable.

Reddit_Comments,Hard_Corsair,"&gt;Every single NFT operation so far has been plagued by scams, malware and the kind of dishonest trading that has been illegal in normal markets for a century.

&amp;#x200B;

Although there have been some wretched schemes using NFT's, most of the high-profile use so far has been no more bullshit than traditional art; a mix of money laundering and rich people paying way too much for an item with no real utility. I wouldn't pay a million dollars for a Bored Ape nor would I pay a million dollars for an original Banksy. That doesn't make either a scam. They aren't right for me but it's none of my business if someone wants to blow that kind of cash on 'artwork'.

Reddit_Comments,_H4_,"Hi !
it seems like you know somewhat the subject, but only the way it was told to sell the idea.

NFT, or non fungible TOKEN, are, as the acronym says, a token, so a link, some random data but not a lot of it.

in the case of videogames, as the company can still crash into oblivion or say that you cant sell things anymore (or just delete your things) , the actual data still being in their servers, there is no benefit to make such market place use NFTs. If you want to see a successful marketplace that use real money, just go and see the CS GO skins and lootbox.

one of the useful ways to use NFTs would be, for exemple, the stock market, with a public database of who own what shares, so that it would be imposible to deny that you owned a stock. As it doesnt need any more data that what could be in the actual NFT, it would be as impermeable as the blockchain (since, Well, it uses it) 

For meta-verse, that is just a large scale virtual world were you can use actual money (not the complete definition, but the one that seems to be used) for some reason they started using it for doing pr stunts, even though things that could fit (like  all ""play to earn"" game) exists since a long time ago (and also mostly proven to be pyramid schemes, or at least not profitable for the end user)",249,i2lyczs,t1_i2lp074,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2lyczs/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

The pitch of the GameStop NFT marketplace is basically bringing the Steam marketplace, which is incredibly successful for valve and devs alike, to consoles, with ideally being able to resell digital games you buy and whatnot. Essentially this would be a digitization of GameStop's core reselling market. This would give the devs a cut of each pre-owned game sold, as well as the parents companies. 

This increases average spending as well as gets ahead of the legal issues that digital licenses are facing, like how France ruled that Steam has to allow digital titles to be resold.

Reddit_Comments,PerfectZeong,"You can do this but I bet you that you make more money when you just set the price yourself. Like if someone sells my nft game for a penny woo great I get a fraction of a penny. You're allowing someone else to determine the price of your game.

I understand how it works I'm saying most publishers would be negatively impacted. They'd make less money than just selling a copy to someone new and not sharing.

And supposing they do this as a plan to cut steam out, how does that benefit them? Steam takes 30% leaving 70% to the publisher and other stakeholders. So in this scenario I sell you a game for 100$ and you play it and sell it as an nft for 50$. What % do I get out of this before its not worth it to me or you? I'd always rather sell a new copy every single time because used will always make me less money. That's why game companies hated gamestop so much because gamestop would sell used games and make huge margin on them and the publishers didn't make dick on it. The ideal situation for the publishers is to never allow a system like that to exist.  Publishers want as big of a % of the sale as they can get which is why some of them started their own store fronts but ultimately realized they were only hurting their sales in the long term and running a store was more expensive than they wanted to believe.

So to do this they'll need to still have their servers distribute and maintain the game so they have to pay all of those costs anyway, so theres no savings, and every game they ever sell can then be turned around and sold to someone else which will yield them a lot less than a new copy, but they have to support it equally

Reddit_Comments,SanityInAnarchy,"Except absolutely none of those things are any more true of NFTs than they are of Steam Marketplace. Adding NFTs doesn't actually solve any of this.

NFTs can absolutely be restricted by the company that launched them -- this can be written into the original smart contract even on a more common chain, and you can of course start your own chain. And both kinds can also give a slice of the pie to the company that launches them, either because it's written into the contract, or because that company controls the entire chain they run on.

The ""cross-platform"" part can be done just as easily with traditional databases as with NFTs. There's these things called APIs, maybe you've heard of them.

Which is to say: Not easily at all. If you thought this would mean you could buy a CS:GO weapon and bring it over to Fortnite or whatever, that would take a fuckton of effort on the part of Epic to support *each* CS weapon, all to introduce a direct competitor for the shit they already sell you in Fortnite, so why on earth would they bother?

And if they don't bother, the only ""cross-platform"" part is that you get a digital receipt that says you own that gun, so that if Valve or CS:GO ever goes away, you can still trade the receipt you have to an asset you can't actually use in any real game anymore. It's like speculating on the value of a ticket for the coat check in a hotel that's burned down.

Same applies to the ""no bans"" part, by the way. If Valve doesn't like you and wants to ban every NFT you own from their games, they can do that easily, because they still control the games themselves. At which point, have fun selling a ""digital good"" that you can't actually use in the same marketplace as other people are selling goods that *can* be used.

Reddit_Comments,atlas_eater,"That‚Äôs a good question, and honestly I don‚Äôt have a comprehensive answer.  

Supply and demand will apply. Basically NFT‚Äôs will give digital assets value, where there is none right now. We all buy, sell and trade physical assets right now and all this is done according to supply and demand and so it‚Äôs the same thing except it‚Äôs extending to digital assets. Another example is digital video games. If you had a physical copy of whatever game, once your done with it you can sell it and make some of your money back, there is value in this physical asset, but if you own a digital game that you payed the same price as the physical game, you cannot do this, you can‚Äôt buy sell or trade it right? So if that game or skin is minted to a NFT you will be able to buy sell and trade or even rent out that copy the same way you would with a physical asset. 

The market place for this isn‚Äôt quite ready yet, but it will be soon and this is what Game Stop is working on. 

Just as a side, Imagine that Tigger woods purchased a digital copy of Tigger Woods PGA tour, he completes the game and sells it back into the digital market, because it‚Äôs on the block chain every one would know that Tigger Woods played it, because it would be documented on the block and that can‚Äôt be changed, so this particular Game would have more value then any other game because of who played it.

The ""First Sale Doctrine"" that makes it legal for anyone to re-sell physical media containing someone else's IP does not apply to digital media.

And, ultimately, why would you even need NFT to create a resale marketplace? There are other mechanisms that exist to track digital licenses and who owns what- NFT isn't solving a problem in that regard. The problem is that software developers and publishers seem to have decided that allowing their customer to resell their products is not good for business.

Reddit_Comments,Hard_Corsair,"&gt;	I find anything that has a mystery bag as the foundation of their market is kinda of a scam to me.

I agree in cases where the odds are kept secret, but the crates are sperate. They existed before the market, and the biggest benefit to the market was a way to buy rate items outright without any luck needed.

&gt;	And even without the loot crates, the price of those digital items continue to drop in any game over a certain period, be it said game quits with major updated or the market itself in game crashed.

One of the big potential benefits of NFT tech for gaming is it creates a framework for cross-game items. Imagine buying a digital hat that isn't game specific. It came from one particular game, but you can equip it on characters in a different game from a different developer.

NFT blockchains provide half of the technical solution to allow that; the other half is a modular game engine that allows for transient assets, and that's still a long ways away. Still, that can eventually lead to something not unlike Ready Player One where different games can crossover together.

Reddit_Comments,thebaron2,"I'm not certain that artists do love NFTs, although I'm sure they love selling anything they can!

In all seriousness, though, I'm not sure the comparison is apt. Right now publishers control the digital marketplace. There is no second hand market, so if a game is launched digitally then you have to pay full price, wait for the publisher to run a promotion, or forego buying the game.

From a publisher POV, IMO that seems like a nice arrangement because the publisher holds all of the cards. There is no way to legally acquire the software outside of the ecosystem that the publisher has set up. And it seems to me that there's a reason this market hasn't been developed. You don't need NFT to establish a resale market on a platform like Steam, for example. You just need the will to do it and the legal rights.

And that's part of the problem, I think. Those legal rights exist explicitly with physical media but they do not exist with digital media. There's something called the ""First Sale Doctrine"" and reselling digital songs, for example, has been litigated and companies that tried to set up resale marketplaces were forced to shut down.

(Here's a [PDF link](http://ia600800.us.archive.org/30/items/gov.uscourts.nysd.390216/gov.uscourts.nysd.390216.109.0.pdf) to a ruling on this topic when a startup company called ReDigi was sued)

So it seems like there is a LOT to be worked out here, and it's surprising to me that if some of these details *have* been hashed out that we haven't heard of any partnerships or anything in this regard.

Time will tell, but I would bet that in 3 years we do not have a digital, second-hand marketplace based on NFT technology. I think it's much more likely that publishers try to maintain control over their revenue streams and shift even further to digital-only.",299,i2l7h8o,t1_i2l3w0o,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2l7h8o/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,thebaron2,"&gt;I would say that there is a second-hand market for digital goods but it's janky and often against a platform's TOS e.g. selling accounts on Ebay or the shady code sites like G2A (which are for all intents and purposes, selling ""2nd hand"" games).

That's a good point, and for cosmetic items or add-ons and such, I can see some kind of NFT marketplace working as long as customers/gamers tolerate it and don't revolt against it like some of the other loot-box applications we've seen over the past couple of years.

&gt;I would also assume that GameSpot wouldn't need to agree to giving publishers a cut of profits as that aspect would be written into the Smart Contract aspect of the NFT.

This is where I am murky on details, so I could totally be wrong but it doesn't *seem* like a 3rd party (GameStop) would be able to ""NFT"" someone else's copyrighted IP for commercial purposes without the original owner granting consent or some kind of license for this kind of use.

This may be where technology is outpacing the law, and I'm actually tempted to go post on /r/law to see if anyone has a take on how this would play out IRL.

&gt;At the end of the day, NFTs are a new technology and solves the question of ""who owns the stuff I paid money for (but that only exists digitally)"".

There aren't currently (that I know of) any marketplaces that do 2nd hand digital goods. However, I believe there is a market for it. For example, the recent legal kerfuffle Bruce Willis got into trying to ""gift"" his Apple Music library to his kids? Or the semi-regular news stories of gaming accounts being hacked and people ""stealing"" ""valuable"" gear. The biggest reason I would assume is due to how difficult it is to set-up something like that, with one of the largest headaches being ""how actually owns the content?"".

I used Steam as an example because it's the most well-known digital distribution platform I can think of. However, I'm not so sure that the team at Valve have even asked the question. Their focus seems to, in recent years, have been ""let's just get as many games as we can"" and, ironically, create digital goods in the form of trading cards, emotes, and other flair for profiles.

Reddit_Comments,CaptainChains,"First question: I don't know NAL.

It all depends on the publisher in question. There are pros and cons of adopting new technologies. 

I would imagine that there are pricing teams in the larger publishers that would run the numbers and figure out the most probable outcome (although I may be putting too much faith in how much publishers care about this stuff). 

Even without the tech, the second-hand game market would still exist. It makes sense to try and grab a slice of that pie.

As mentioned the Smart Contract aspect of NFTs could allow publishers to take a cut of each resale of the game. But who knows?

Reddit_Comments,CreativeGPX,"Basically. Which is why as /u/PhoebusQ47 says, it's not a required or good way to do it.

1. A paper contract can specify/limit the terms of alteration and can be publicly available. So, NFTs aren't unique in offering these.
2. These two features often aren't desirable. Many people rightly value their privacy with respect to their possessions and contracts. Also, many people rightly value that contracts can be acted upon through other means. For example, the courts can help you transfer property in the case of inheritance or theft, while the blockchain cannot.
3. Both traditional contracts and NFTs are useless on their own because anybody can just ignore them. What gives them teeth is the body that enforces them. Traditional contracts are enforced by court systems and law enforcement. NFTs don't seem to offer anything beyond that in terms of ensuring that the contract is carried out, but in some cases might offer less.
4. The blockchain is (especially presently) an extremely inefficient and expensive way to operate by design.
5. While ""trust"" is in theory helped by the blockchain, that's not really a guarantee. The blockchain is controlled by anonymous miners proportionately to their resources. In other words, it still might be controlled by enormous corporate or government interests at any point. While we don't necessarily trust corporations in general, non-blockchain solutions at least offer a name, face and legal entity so that we can make informed judgements about trust or even hold the entity accountable legally or otherwise.",246,i2kpvcb,t1_i2k4h6b,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2kpvcb/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,AHedgeKnight,"Ah yes the classic 'NFTs are for the working man!' argument

NFTs are an inherently exploitative scam stapled onto an already exploitative scam pushed by extremely wealthy tech moguls and corporations that exploit the gullibility of the millions of people who are blinded by techy buzzwords they don't understand to join into a pyramid scheme that more resembles technological astrology than it does an actual advancement in tech. You aren't investing in a system that helps the working class, you're fetishizing something that will help stomp on them further. At least when MTX became a thing in video games most people didn't worship them like they were fucking sacred.

The entire system is a pyramid scheme with no actual ethics or morals behind it being peddled to separate gullible people like you from more of your hard-earned money because of some promise that you'll be one of the ones who got in early enough and got lucky enough to get mega rich because a tech bro living in a 35 million dollar house in Santa Clarita spams Twitter forty times an hour trying to encourage anyone listening to them to join their fraud while masturbating over their completely false self-image of being low class rags to riches wealth out to help the little guy against the corporate overlords. Almost all of these men got unfathomably wealthy in the .Com Boom or in the early 2000s social media explosion and none of the dessicated ghouls who peddle this shit care about you or your financial well-being.

So when this technology is not leading to thousands of gambling addicts and children being scammed out of their life savings or those of the people they dragged into it, and when it's not worsening the climate crisis due to the insane energy inefficiency and waste inherent in this system, it's solving zero actual issues for any consumer and works just to squeeze any money possible out of them while patting them on the ass and telling them it's actually a great thing and they'll totally benefit in the end.

It's more of an intense gut instinct tied with my digital forensics background and the use of hash values. 

We use hashes to validate the images we grab from systems we're investigating, that way we can verify no fuckery has occurred after the image was taken. I personally see NFTs closely associated with that, and believe I can see the money that people want to make behind it. 

It feels to me, many people share a similar belief as me, which increases the chance of my belief coming to fruition.

Gamestop pays no dividends, because it has no profit. It's seemingly launching an NFT platform, which is another level of investment with no underlying value.

Reddit_Comments,ryu1940,"
Imagine instead of only selling a game once to get cash flow, you‚Äôre also given the opportunity of getting cash flow from every transaction that happens in game.

If a user bought lets say an addon to a game but later resold it to another player, the game creators would make money off the initial sale plus scalp some profits from the follow on sales. These follow on transactions are limitless. 

Now let‚Äôs look at the context of gaming as it stands currently. Many games have to be on a game marketplace like steam which takes 20-30% of your sales for the privilege. You have to accept those terms because if you aren‚Äôt on Steam (or it‚Äôs rivals), it‚Äôs going to be hard to see sales. A few of these marketplaces are again NFT sales because places like steam only want your game to work within the confines of your steam account and want control over all your purchases tied to your steam account. 

With that said, if GameStop came to you and said they had essentially a bolt on solution which would tie your game into their NFT marketplace seamlessly and would allow you to scalp a percentage of profits off all in game transactions you‚Äôd likely do it. Instead of developers getting revenue from seasonal sales over the course of a game‚Äôs lifetime they are constantly getting revenue off all the in game transactions. This will help games last longer. All the games I like currently survive by regularly scheduled DLC output. 

There‚Äôs currently 100 million in grant money given out  by the company Immutable X (who is partnered with GameStop to build out the backend of this all) which can be used by developers who need funding to get this started.",294,i2kik88,t1_i2ke9ej,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2kik88/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Franss22,"You're out of your mind if you think the entirety (or most of) the gaming industry is going to up and change to open source distribution.

By definition ([https://opensource.org/osd](https://opensource.org/osd)) you cannot stop redistribution of open source software, completely defeating the idea of ""ownership of your games via NFT"".   


So it'd have to be private distributed storage to which the NFT gives you access. What happens when the company stops existing and stops paying for storage? Unless you suggest the gaming industry should run on some kind of charitable free distributed storage global organization.

IF the game checks your ownership of the NFT before being able to play, it is no different from it checking an internal database and letting you play, and nothing stops the company from updating the game and changing who, if any, can access it, just like you fear from steam.  


And all of this isn't even taking into account online multiplayer games. How does having a proof of ownership stop companies from shutting down servers?  


There already exists a physical, unique and anonymous proof of ownership for software. Its circular, with a hole in its center, and likes to spin really fast.

Reddit_Comments,metallice,"None of this is true. With an NFT you have nothing more than the keys to a receipt stored on a blockchain. A receipt that at most does little more than point to a URL or some arbitrary number that someone else has to say means anything.

You having a receipt that you bought music means nothing. If it's for mp3s that receipt stops nobody from copying it. For copy protected tracks or streams the access to that music is still entirely up to the right holder or supplier of that stream. They decide whether you have access based on your NFT and can revoke it at any time. Oh you sold your NFT pointing to a URL to someone else and they didn't like it? Oops well the web host / rights holder decided they don't like that and just made the link useless. You and your blockchain key are powerless. At that point you may as well use a much faster and more efficient standard database.

This applies to all of the things you listed. NONE of these things are actually stored on a blockchain (and couldn't be) meaning they are nothing more than an inefficient receipt that someone else decides matters or not. Which means they might as well host the database themselves... which is what they already do. There is zero benefit to NFTs. If game companies wanted to make cosmetics and items that work between games they already can... With a database. Putting it on a blockchain does nothing.

Reddit_Comments,Franss22,"And how would the NFT help you get the game? Right, you'd have to connect to their database with whatever key is inside the NFT (either to get it in the first place or validate it), thus still giving control of your product to the corporation.   
So please, explain to me how exactly would the process of a decentralized, NFT based game marketplace work, and why would any sane corporation choose to do this instead of keeping control of their games and servers.   


Maybe it can be done, but as you're trying to sell it to me now, it just has the same problems as before but with extra steps. No corporation would chooose to not control the way their game is downloaded. Even if the storage is decentralized, the company can always choose to stop offering downloads. And if the solution to that would be ""but since the storage is decentralized its out of their hands now"", you'd be distributing a product without the permission of their owner, so just torrent piracy with extra carbon emissions.",181,i2kdb0i,t1_i2ka6y0,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2kdb0i/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,CaptainChains,"Often when you buy a digital product you don‚Äôt ‚Äúown‚Äù it, you‚Äôre simply buying a license that allows you to use it. Take Steam as an example, most users have a huge library of games that they don‚Äôt play so the games just sit there doing nothing. NFTs can be traded so these games that are sitting in libraries can then be sold or traded.

An NFT platform that allows this kind of trading would/will revolutionise the second hand game market. 

You can apply this principle to loads of other digital goods like iTunes, Fortnite skins, online memberships, and whatever else you can think of.

On top of that you can apply ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù to NFTs that give additional functionality to the digital good. A ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù is just a function that triggers when certain conditions are met. An example that‚Äôs often talked about is artist royalties being paid whenever anyone buys an NFT of their work. This example alone is, again, revolutionary as it should remove a tonne of admin and legal work that goes into both the creation and implementation of the current ‚Äúdumb contract‚Äù system.

But hey it's an nft and somehow Ubisoft bought into this idea so you can transfer it to the latest ass creed game! Except... They just made your nft an icon for your user profile or something and when they ported the image they didn't align it properly so you can't even see the image they made very well.

Reddit_Comments,toderdj1337,"So a key point here is incentive. Sure you can (kinda) sell cd keys but it gets messy and publishers (steam) hates it, however; there is a way to make the industry get on board, and that's to make it (somewhat) profitable for them.

 What NFT's do is enable smart contracts built in, so say whatever the NFT (tied to a tangible asset) sells for x dollars, the marketplace (gamestop) and the developer (say a studio like CD project red) gets a cut. This would incentivize developers to skip steam and go with gamestop. Depending on if steam choses to adapt to the new model or die with their monopoly, the industry will change. 

My personal hope is that indie developers will be able to make good games on their own without bending the knee to the large publishers, hopefully leading to a Renaissance in gaming similar to the early 2000's.

Now this is all just for gaming. NFT's have a whole lot more potential, basically making paper certificates and ownership obsolete, along with a whole lot of bureaucracies and middlemen like lawyers, and potentially even banks. That is the most optimistic scenario, but either way, NFT's are going to be a thing, it just depends on how they're used.",209,i2k4jml,t1_i2k2fwl,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2k4jml/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Toby_O_Notoby,"Yeah, but it's not like you think about some weird memeable art piece or something. Basically NFTs stands for ""Non Fungible Tokens"" and means you own a piece of digital property on a blockchain. 

For example that's closer to what Gamestop is trying to do, the band Kings of Leon released 25 NFT tickets that grant you access to any and every concert they might have as well as backstage passes and other such goodies. So there are 25 people in the world who have this exclusive access. But if at any time they want to sell it they can post it on the blockchain and the highest bidder wins. 

What GME is proposing is letting you own an NFT within a game. So they could release a skin on, say, Fortnite where there are only 100 of them in existence. You now own this skin and if you ever want to sell it you can. So instead of spending a couple of bucks on a skin where you will never see your money again, GME creates a marketplace where you can treat the skin like an investment where you can sell it off when you no longer want it.",200,i2k0v1l,t1_i2jyhes,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2k0v1l/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0
Reddit_Comments,Fangro,"Answer: Before I answer, I would like to mention that I am a GME investor and I fully believe there will be a MOASS. I will try to be as impartial as I can in my answer, but please keep this in mind.

Some time ago it was discovered that GME has a lot of their stock shorted. Putting it very simple, what that means is that a party ""borrowed"" a stock and sold it, with the intention to buy it and ""return"" it at a later date (close their position). If the price falls, they make money. If the prices rises, they lose money. Since they have to eventually buy the stock at any price and since there were so many stocks shorted, them buying it back would cause a rapid increase in price. This is called ""Short Squeeze"". People interested in GME refer to it as Mother Of All Short Squeezes (MOASS).

Over a year ago, there was a big increase in GME price. While some people believe that was the short squeeze, other like me believe that this was a gamma squeeze (other terms are often used). What we mean is that the price has been increased by other factors, such us retail investors (individual people) getting into FOMO and buying up the stock. There are many good explanations why this is the case and how the hedge funds that shorted GME keep hiding their short positions, which can be found on any GME related subreddits.

The price has been going up and down since then due to various reasons, one of which is that a lot of retail investors are very interested in buying more GME and Direct Registering the Shares (DRS). What it means that you directly register the shares in your own name, rather than have your broker holding them (again, the subs have a lot of information on what it is and how to do it). Most recent big things that could have caused the most recent increase are the following:  
\- GameStop officially announced they will be launching NFT marketplace in a matter of months;  
\- GameStop chairman Ryan Cohen bought a lot more GME shares;  
\- Other board members bought more GME shares;  
\- There appears to be more chatter about it on reddit, which could have led to more retail investors buying.

Overall, ""GME Saga"" has been going for over a year now, so we'll see where this takes us!",410,i2jyr4z,t3_tqw0lh,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2jyr4z/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Many speculates that shorts never closed their position, they've been using illegal methods/loopholes like ""covering"" their shorts with synthetic long shares generated from the use of options.  
GME is going up again due to the news surrounding their NFT marketplace and the fact that more than 125 000 GME holders have directly registered more than 10 million GME shares (and still growing) under their names through the GME transfer agent Computershare, these shares are out of DTCC/brokers therefore locked away from the short sellers.

Reddit_Comments,StaticS1gnal,"A translation for the 'whitelist' bit:

NFTs are essentially a speculative stock market, or a multi-level marketing (ponzi) scheme. All the money is made by obtaining the NFT(s) for a low price and reselling at a higher one. So being able to get a free or cheap NFT and reselling to someone else at a higher price is the game and the goal.

Whitelisting is a guaranteed opportunity to 'mint' an NFT. To purchase it as 'new'. Meaning you are the first buyer, and don't have the costs associated with each person who held it before you selling it for higher prices to the next buyer.  The further down the chain of sales the NFT is (the more times its been sold), the more the person holding it wants to sell it for in order to recoup their costs and to make money. 

Additionally, Each time an NFT is minted, it typically has a processing fee (often referred to as 'gas money' by the community).  With NFTs, multiple people may try to mint (buy) at the same time, and the minted NFT goes to the highest bidder. The higher bid is paid in the form OG 'gas money', or these processing fees. Whitelisting avoids the bidding war of processing fees (called a gas war) by guaranteeing you get first dibs and set price.

In short, you're getting in on the ground floor of a ponzi scheme. Be one of the first buyers, face minimal competition to secure your buy, and then hope you can find someone that'll buy from you at a higher price.

Bear in mind with all of this that the goal of the NFT holder is to dupe someone else into buying their NFT for a bigger price than what they paid. So, if they say they are selling to you for a fair price, or that you are 'getting in on the ground floor' of their scheme.... They may be saying whatever it takes to get you to buy.",331,hzvr7wi,t1_hztdnf5,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/t9a5sr/whats_the_deal_with_people_tweeting_help_wendy/hzvr7wi/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Aevum1,"ANSWER: 

A NFT is a non fungible token, meaning a token that can not be exchnged or used.

The idea is that you take any digital object like a picture, a audio recording, a video recording or basically anything digital, and creature a hash or signature of it which is encoded through a blockchain system usually Ethereum. so you dont own the object, you own a hash/signature creatured using the object at that moment, 

Why do people hate them ?

- Using the Ethereum blockchain, minting a NFT is very power consuming and pulluting, just as refernce, your cellphone battery for its entire use is around 15Wh, and a 4 family household usually uses around 100 KWh a week.  

Minting (Creation): 142 kWh, 83 KgCO2

- Its led to a lot of art theft, since most NFT marketplaces dont verify that you own the image you¬¥re using to mint the NFT, People have been just going around google images, blogs, thumbler, or whatever and grabbing whatever they can mint and sell, since some plataforms allow you to mind your first NFT for free or charge you a % of the NFT value instead of charging you a minting cost,  its easy money. 

- The quality of the art is questionable, some of the most popular collections like the Bored Ape Yatch Club or the Lazy Lions are just repetitive junk that dont even hold the standard that would be used for collectors cards that come with bubble gum, also there has been an incident related to a creator creating a NFT series based on a youtuber that commited suicide a few years back ""honoring him"" when actually none of the money went to his family and he had no permission from his estate. 

- They are seen as a Money laundering sceme or a Pyramid scam, many see NFT¬¥s as a way for rich people to hide their money and for other people to get reach easly selling a worthless product that will lose all its value in a few months like beanie babies. 

- It seems very disconnected from reality, people are spending hundereds of thosands of dollars on a signed recipt of a object (not even the object itself) while the pandemic has caused a decline in living conditions for the low and middle class, leading to a ""let them eat cake"" situation where you hear that some rich guy spend $400,000 on some digital signature of a picture of a stupid ape when a lot of people are having problems keeping the lights on and a roof over their head, the most blatant case was with Jimmy Fallon and Paris Hilton showing off their NFT¬¥s on the tonight show while talking and the entire audiance was like ""are these people stupid?""",483,hyr6kif,t3_t3a9gv,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/t3a9gv/whats_going_on_with_nfts/hyr6kif/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

The reality is that the tech is largely useless, bad for the environment and the NFT market and crypto in general is more or less a Greater Fool game. 

More relevant to your question, it's been a common pattern for a lot of content creators to get into NFTs not fully understanding the tech or even basic copyright laws.

Reddit_Comments,HotCupofChocolate,"There is hate from many sides.

First, it seems like everyone and their mother want to jump into nfts to make a quick buck, sometimes in a distasteful manner.

For example, the official Twitter account of the late Stan Lee was used to advertise nfts, as was the account of Bob Ross, not to mention many other big corporations.

Gamers hate them for various reasons. 

For example, some videogame studios have advocated for integration of nfts into games in what many gamers see as another tactic to shove useless micro transactions into games to make more money.

Also because transactions on the block chain need quite some computing power, it has caused many PC components to become scarce or more difficult to obtain, which was already difficult due to scalpers and the chip shortage. 

The art community also hates them. 

Art theft is rampant among nfts. Like you could be a small artist posting your art on the web and the next week find out that someone took your art, applied some basic filter and uploaded it to the marketplace to be sold (this happened to Simon Stalenhag, one of my favorite artists).

In some of the worst cases, they even profit from dead people. There was an artist that suffered from a terminal condition, something they reflected in their art, that eventually passed away, and their art was later used for nfts after someone impersonated them. There was also nfts based on Etika and George Floyd. 

Not to mention that in general nft art is seen as ugly (because it escentially has to be mass produced) and not worth the exorbitant prices tag they come with.

There is a video by YouTuber Solar Sands that explains nfts, although focusing more on the art side of it if you're interested.",294,hxx7a9c,t1_hxwpiae,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sy8pzm/whats_going_on_with_the_hate_for_nfts_and_people/hxx7a9c/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0
Reddit_Comments,yublie,"I think the biggest sources of hate are:

* NFTs are built on top of cryptocurrencies, which are attempts to create ""decentralized"" currencies that are controlled by a collection of private companies and individuals instead of a government. Due to some poor design choices, the most popular cryptocurrencies incentivize people to have lots of computers running pointless calculations, to the point where the overall energy use of cryptocurrency has become very large (comparable to a small-ish country), despite the fact that cryptocurrencies aren't even used that widely and arguably don't serve much of a purpose at all.

* The cryptocurrency industry has already seen several significant speculative bubbles, in which people ""invest"" in assets in the belief that their price will ""go to the moon"", and NFTs are the latest of these. Lots of people have bought into the hype and have invested all of their savings into them, while lots of people are intentionally driving up the hype and profiting from people's greed and naivety. A very simple and common way that they do this is by ""wash trading"" - they create an NFT and trade it backwards and forwards between their own accounts for high prices while using social media to hype it up, creating the illusion that it is considered very valuable. They then sell it to a sucker who has seen the price going up and up and thinks they can make a profit. Then they disappear from the market and suddenly there is no interest in the NFT any more, and the sucker can't sell it.

* The most obvious incarnation of NFTs is those extremely ugly ape profile pictures.",272,hxx3ugq,t1_hxwpiae,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sy8pzm/whats_going_on_with_the_hate_for_nfts_and_people/hxx3ugq/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

MLMs and crypto are pretty much dead in the water. If people want to gamble, fine, but at this point the only money left is table scraps and any greater idealized vision for either is undone by the spectators: crypto will never be viable so long as the only people buying into it are doing so for investment purposes to cash out for other currencies, and NFTs are basically an artificial market for crypto to buy but as an artificial capital to justify a token economy: on a good day they're casino chips.",156,hxwxh2k,t1_hxwpiae,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sy8pzm/whats_going_on_with_the_hate_for_nfts_and_people/hxwxh2k/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0
Reddit_Comments,44no44,"The documentary can put things in perspective better than any brief summary you'll find here, but to paraphrase a few of the easy points:

* NFTs are built off of blockchain technology, which (to vastly oversimplify) is a sort of decentralized database software that stores data redundantly across a vast network of random people's computers. The blockchain verifies the authenticity of a given transaction by updating it across as much of the database as possible. This has the roundabout side-effect that the system gets less and less efficient as it expands. The more popular a blockchain becomes, the more disproportionate, wasted electricity has to be burned updating it - exponentially moreso than a regular centralized database. Cryptocurrencies are even worse for this than NFTs, but the problem is still there. Many people worry about the environmental cost that will come from widespread adoption of such inefficient technology.

* NFTs are an unregulated market, with all the problems that brings.  The art market was already rife with money laundering and NFTs just make that even easier. Since there's very little restrictions on minting a new NFT, there's nothing stopping people from turning other artists' work into NFTs to be sold without their permission. Since an NFT can be *any* packet of data, not just images, hackers can create bite-sized malware, package it as an NFT, and put it straight into people's wallets to steal everything they have. Et cetera.

* NFT supporters aggressively reproduce like some loud and annoying virus. Naturally, since it's strictly a zero-sum market, anyone who buys an NFT can only ever see returns on that purchase by swindling someone else into buying it from them later for an even higher price. The system gives buyers an incentive to plague the internet with as much misleading overhyped drivel as possible. You don't spend ten thousand dollars on an ape jpeg and *not* treat NFTs like the second coming of Christ - that'd be financial suicide. So it's not just especially naive fools buying in at their own expense. Plenty of reasonable people are scammed into it by the sheer volume of aggressive marketing surrounding them. This is the number one reason people on the internet are so hostile towards anyone who brings up NFTs: the entire topic is a parasite. Granting it any semblance of legitimacy, intentional or otherwise, is just adding fuel to the fire. It's a market propped up by hype and hype alone. Better to shun the whole concept into irrelevance than ever give it the time of day.",422,hxwx4gz,t1_hxwpiae,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sy8pzm/whats_going_on_with_the_hate_for_nfts_and_people/hxwx4gz/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

For a while they were an exciting/confusing/infuriating loop hole of commerce with millions of dollars being tossed around on the ""original"" image of memes, this part I'm going to assume you know. 

There was a veritable gold rush of content where people raced to generate NFTs as people began buying, selling, trading and stealing NFTs in a wholly unregulated market. At this juncture it's largely seen that the gold rush is over. NFTs are often compared to MLMs where anyone getting in on it now is already too late. Proponents of NFTs will argue what you said, ""people are making money and it seems harmless. I thought people have owned digital art for ages,"" but the reality is that people aren't really making money.

Reddit_Comments,Eona_Targaryen,"Answer: (From a layman): As the owner of an NFT you do not own the image in any way, shape, or form. You pay to have your name typed into a specific slot in the database of owners, that slot is assigned the image purely as representation instead of calling it Slot #5823987 or whatever. If the database owner decides to change your linked NFT pic into a photo of their ass, it's their full legal right and you now have a link to a photo of their ass, if they shut down the database, it's their full legal right and you now have a link to nothing.

It's essentially the old ""buy a star"" scam that private companies used to run. No, you are not now the legal overlord of Star 68372 now, the seller never owned Star 68372, nobody is infringing your rights if they do stuff with Star 68372. If you read the fine print you just paid for the privilege of some random person to write down ""Bob owns star 68372"" in their notebook and mail you a certificate.

NFT owners either don't understand what they're actually buying the rights to and falsely believe they own the art (which is why screenshotting NFTs is commonly used to make fun of these people). Or they're hoping to make money by hyping up the value of their NFTs to buyers, often using semi-legal techniques to manipulate item history. Or they're just straight-up using them to launder money from illegal activities. Because so few laws are set up to cover NFTs at this point, they're a battleground for all sorts of shenanigans that would otherwise be illegal or heavily regulated, and have about zero consumer protection.

The last factor that really annoys people about NFTs is their impact on computer hardware availability. The NFT and Cryptocurrency markets kinda go hand-in-hand, and both require a lot of people to contribute computing power to keep running. Combined with the pandemic supply issues, the booms in these markets basically torpedoed the availability of certain high-end computer equipment, such as graphics cards. Graphics cards basically turned into a scalper's wet dream and it has been extremely difficult for awhile for anybody with a professional computer to secure the computer upgrades they need for a reasonable price.",380,hxrv8ds,t3_sxeoar,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sxeoar/what_is_the_deal_with_nfts/hxrv8ds/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Talk about ""DESPERATE semantics"".  You're caught contradicting yourself, so you back-pedal. Next time, just say what you (supposedly) mean to begin with.

Anyway, so, an NFT is like when I buy a service?  If I pay for, I dunno, a foot rub, then I get ""nothing of substance"". I don't walk away with ""a TANGIBLE, PHYSICAL THING"".  or let's say I buy internet Service- what ""TANGIBLE, PHYSICAL THING"" do I get from buying broadband internet?

The NFT provides a service- a blockchain pointer to a copy of a picture. You may not think it's worth a lot- or anything at all- but evidently other people do.

Technically you own that paper, but you don't actually own anything related to the star at all.  That's what an NFT.

When you describe factories, you are describing the creation of a TANGIBLE, PHYSICAL THING.  To compare that in any way shape or form is laughably juvenile.  They're physical objects sold into a regulated market.  There are licenses, fees, laws, etc.  An NFT isn't a thing.  It's a pointer.  It's a SCAM.  Nothing more.

But then you say if th image is changed that ""then you are now the proud owner of a blockchain pointer to a copy of a picture of my nosehair. Or I could delete it entirely and you own a blockchain pointer to nothing.""

So, is an NFT ""nothing"", or is it a reference on a the blockchain? it cannot be both. So, which is it?

&gt;The only actual monetary value from buying an NFT is the assumption that you can then sell that NFT on to someone else at a greater value.

So, basically the same with everything else.  Factories produce widgets, which are bought in large lots by Wholesalers, who assume they can sell them on in smaller lots (and higher prices per each) to retailers.  And retailers assume they can sell them on to consumers at a higher price still.   No one buys stuff with the hope it will sell for *less* later.

Reddit_Comments,VHZer0,"The amount of people that don't know the most basic function of an NFT is eye opening. Maybe I'm looking too much into it, but to me it points to a lack of transparency. My first impression when I was introduced to it was that it was essentially online trading cards, but even then I thought the ownership of an online trading card was silly considering any image or gif must be downloaded in order to be displayed. Come to find out it's even farther removed from the online trading card comparison.

And then there's so... SO much more bullshit piled on top of it from the psychology of NFT discords and groups, the fake humanitarianism via the Axie game, to what certain people are claiming NFTs could do and it's mostly idealistic, complete shit, or completely idealistic shit. People on the outside are treating crypto and NFTs like an MLM because it's the closest tangible comparison. That's before the realization that NFTs are bits of caveman code that can do what code has done in the hands of the malicious for the last 15 years: scam, cheat, and destroy. Oh and good luck getting justice for that since the system is purposely obtuse in nature to stop man in the middle attacks (attacks that have been pointless for a while when you can just ask grandma for her credit card information and steal everything that way) unless you already had a fuck off amount of money.

When it comes down to it, NFT sellers are selling you a position in a queue that is associated with a program that you don't own that generally points to a fugly procedurally generated image on a server that runs the same shut down risk as any other image on the internet.

Reddit_Comments,Beardy_Boy_,"Answer:. Fundamentally, an NFT is a unique token on a blockchain.  All this really means is that it's an entry on the ledger that can be tracked to that specific transaction.  It's kind of a cryptocurrency where only one of the token is ever produced.

People are buying NFTs that are supposedly connected to things like digital art, Twitter posts, and the like, with the idea being that they hold some sort of ownership over the thing itself.  The problem is that the only thing they actually own is the NFT.  It doesn't give any sort of legal control over the thing it's attached to, it doesn't grant you access to an account, and it doesn't give you any royalties when the items are sold.

NFTs are functionally very similar to buying a plot of land on the moon.  You have a fun little certificate saying you own something, but the reality is that the two things don't map onto each other at all.

I'm sure there must be *some* legitimate use case for NFTs, but for the most part it's just a digital beanie baby, except all you're really buying is an accounting entry.",197,hvsnahe,t3_sld7yc,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sld7yc/what_is_up_with_nfts/hvsnahe/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0
Reddit_Comments,flyingpimonster,"Answer: The environmental costs are real and lots of people hate NFTs for that. But when it comes to celebrities pushing NFTs, people hate it for being a cash grab. NFTs are fairly cheap to make and sell for high prices due to the hype. However, they don't really provide any practical value (like typical merch would), not even aesthetic value since anyone can *look at* the artwork online. The value of an NFT is only getting to say you are the *owner* of the NFT. Alternately, it's worth what someone else who wants to ""own"" it more than you do will pay you for it.

So it's mostly a way to capitalize on one's fame. It doesn't help that the NFT space is *full* of scams--pump &amp; dumps, wash trading, etc. Often the celebrity gets some money and the fans are left holding the bag when, inevitably, their NFTs aren't worth what they were promised.",155,hvrq9n3,t3_sld7yc,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sld7yc/what_is_up_with_nfts/hvrq9n3/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,DVeagle74,"Answer: [Here is a good in depth video. ](https://youtu.be/YQ_xWvX1n9g) But to give a shorter answer. Nft stands for Non-Fungible Token. Essentially it's a unique key that can be pointed at anything online as a sort of receipt of ownership. It's verified and transferred using blockchain technology, which uses networked computers to be decentralized and heavy energy costs. Blockchain is also its the tech behind cryptocurrancy like bitcoin.

Issues with nfts come from multiple places, the community around them, their uselessness, their energy impact, and scams.

The community is very hype driven and loud, so you get lots of very intense support and harsh reactions to criticism.

Much like buying a star, or land on the moon, or a title from Sealand, nfts don't really provide much for your ownership. It's digital art, so it's infinitely replicated as anything online. So it mostly comes off as a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. So at the moment it's treated as a speculation product. They are bought to be sold to someone else later, aka digital bennie babies. 

Transactions with nfts use a lot of computers and a a large amount of energy. The environmental impact isn't small.

Scams are also common among nfts. From imcomplete projects, to just simply taking stuff from people. There's little to no regulation so it runs rampant with no recourse.",221,hvqtqy0,t3_sld7dd,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sld7dd/what_is_up_with_nfts_what_are_they_why_the_hate/hvqtqy0/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0
Reddit_Comments,Sloloem,"Licensing of digital media was already a fairly well-solved problem.  As much as I hate DRM schemes they mostly functioned as long as you stayed away from edge cases, they just didn't have a speculative marketplace or artificial scarcity attached to it.  So if you consider making things worse so that you can try to bilk idiots desperately trying to score some free money by running a hypetrain backed by unregulated speculation a solution to anything...then NFTs are your solution.

The NFT is just a link embedded in a transaction on an immutable distributed transaction ledger saying that this hash token is currently assigned to Steve McSteve's Wallet.  So it's ownership really only in a technical sense that some chunk of metadata is assigned to a user account and not in any material or legal way.  That's really all it proves, anything more is a gentleman's agreement that ""Sure, I'll say you own whatever file is at the other end of that link.  I'll even let you sell me a new transaction that says it's not assigned to my wallet.""  Can't really do anything else with it.

Block chain doesn't even really establish provenance, just establishes who created the transaction and what wallet it's assigned to.  Plenty of NFT's point at stolen artwork that the person who minted wasn't granted any permission to use and certainly isn't paying royalties on.

But let's be clear about the main point here for anyone still playing along at home:  There is no such thing as ownership of digital media.  Ownership implies scarcity and because it is digital there can be no scarcity.  To digital media you either have access or you don't but no matter how many people are given access to a piece of digital media, it will _never_ run out.  It's frankly more difficult to limit consumption of a digital asset than it is to allow consumption.

Scarcity of tokens is a purely artificial construct and exists entirely for its own sake.  It doesn't carry with it any rights, ownership, or value.  Its scarcity that means nothing because it's trying to impose itself on something that is for all intents and purposes, post-scarcity.  An NFT linking to a photo of Alf confers no more ownership over Alf, conceptually, physically, or even that particular photo any more than a POG with a photo Alf confers ownership over anything more than a POG.",410,hvlrkvg,t1_hvirz3x,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sjr9d4/whats_the_deal_with_these_articles_writing_about/hvlrkvg/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,chaosof99,"NFTs are in general considered bad for a number of reasons:

1) NFTs are a ""bigger fool"" scam. NFTs only appreciate in value not because they themselves have an intrinsic market value that rises and falls with supply and demand, but because you sold it to someone else for a higher price than you bought it for.

2) NFTs are bought and sold for with Etherium and other cryptocurrencies. They are sometimes considered a prop to push up the cryptocurrency marketplace. The most common cryptocurrencies are made through ""proof of work"", which is basically a mechanism that sets a math riddle. The first person that solves it gets cryptocurrency for it. However, this is a race, so every other participant who also attempted and invested resources (energy, processor time) gets nothing, and all this redundant work serves nothing.

3) The verification of NFTs and actions on them (e.g. transferring them to another owner) are also done with proof of work or similar inefficient mechanisms.

The supposed use case for NFTs in games is that you can trade in-game items on a different marketplace, and you game developers could use such in-game items from existing games in theirs. However, this use case is absurd on its face. Games are insular spaces. You don't want to have outside code in your game, and I doubt any developer would want to spend time and effort implementing items from another game. It also makes no sense to distribute verifiability, since you always have to verify against the platform owner anyhow. A user would also have to associate their crypto wallet with an account at the game, which defeats a purpose of cryptocurrency: anonymity.",275,hvf9s28,t1_hvelxrw,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/siqg2r/whats_going_on_with_nfts/hvf9s28/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,chilled_n_shaken,"Wtf are you even talking about? You don't even understand the core mechanics of the examples you posted above, yet try to say others that they are ""misinformed"". NFTs are great for money laundering because the market is highly unregulated. The Blockchain may keep track of every transaction, but it is easy to set up a wallet hooked up to a shell company that isn't linked to you personally. Also, because it is decentralized, there is no government that will take responsibility for crimes committed on them, so it is perfect for money laundering. 

As for the pokemon cards, nobody knew what was in the box. A company certified that the box matched the description and had the proper labels and was the correct weight, but it's impossible to know what was truly in the box until opened. Having an NFT connected to a physical object would not have helped because it still cannot guarantee the object in the box is actually in there, regardless of whether you own the NFT. And if you're just going to trade digital cards, then sure, the NFT could help with that but your relying on the game itself as a centralized monitoring tool to use the card within the game. But that can already be done within a game with internal checks. Decentralizing this piece of it is nonsensical unless there is a secondary platform that supports the NFT with the same game code. So far nobody has actually successfully created an NFT that corresponds to an in-game item that transfers between games. It is a nonsensical idea considering the NFT cannot provide the necessary gaming code to introduce the item within every game, so it would have to be manually created within each platform which will literally never happen.

&gt;what's to stop someone from copying it and hence it losing all value

Imagine buying a comb from ""Silky Hair"". There are millions of these combs out there but the one you bought for thousands of dollars is the favorite comb of your favorite celebrity. The value of this comb therefore comes from all other fans who want this comb.

  
Same with the idea of NFTs. The value comes from a few millionaires hyping up NFTs and therefore raising the value ""because they deem it valuable"". It's even common practice to sell an NFT to yourself for insane amounts using a fake account or by cooperating with another seller for a minor fee - just to make the news!

  
Plus keeping track of all the transactions consumes a lot of energy and basically kills our planet which in regards of the actual usefulness of NFTs is pretty shit - same with bitcoins btw.

Reddit_Comments,Iseedeadnames,"Answer: it is not digital art you own. When you buy an NFT you buy (usually) the right to reproduce a certain image, similarly to how you only get a licence for Windows rather the ownership of your copy.

The implications are numerous, but just to sum up a couple: the image resides on a server and not your PC therefore making it inaccessible should the link with the server disappear, the image is not unique and the author can sell it to multiple people (stark difference with regular art market), the image itself is not what you buy since you're buying instead the blockchain that leads to your NFT. The blockchain structure does prevent theft or misuse of said NFT and the token itself will remain unique in your possession, but the system is unable to control the media outside the crypto itself; aka, the token will stay yours but the image itself contained within can be copied through screenshots, photos or similar systems. The only way to protect a NFT outside the blockchain circuit is through international laws, that at the moment are a bit hazy on the subject and it's really not clear whether someone could be sued for copyright breach for using a NFT screenshot in their profile.

To mint and sell an NFT you don't need to own any right to the image, you can simply take any jpg or screenshot from the web. Some crafted NFTs from the profiles and images owned by dead youtubers and influencers, some have created NFTs from popular and common memes; you can easily understand that in this kind of setting it's pretty hard to seriously consider any pretense of legitimacy for copyright claims.

The NFT market is also plagued by money laundering, with people buying tokens for high sums just to trade in money made with illegal activities that take advantage of the lack of control on crypto trades.",318,hvaaxg8,t3_siqg2r,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/siqg2r/whats_going_on_with_nfts/hvaaxg8/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

When it comes to legal enforcement of ownership, this is handled by copyright law. The artist can sue someone copying the image who doesn't have the NFT, but only because they wrote and/or signed a separate contract with either the NFT website or the buyer.

NFTs do not do this. The point at issue is not what's literally encoded in the blockchain, it's the image the NFT is based on. Having ownership of a token does not inherently mean you have information as to the identity of the artist of the original image, nor does it inherently grant you copyright of said original. In that sense, NFTs will ALWAYS be easily counterfeited, because the ""right-clicking"" you supposedly laugh at is the exact method by which people mint NFTs based on art they didn't create.

Reddit_Comments,Castriff,"&gt;As long as people understand that they own the NFT and NOT the art

I guarantee you, out of those who are legitimately interested in buying NFTs, at least 90% (a generous estimate, in my opinion) either don't understand this in the slightest, or are taking advantage of those who don't. In fact, the token doesn't even guarantee that the link to the server which holds the artwork will remain usable. Not only do you not own the art, you can't do anything to keep the art where you want it to be. (That's the difference between NFTs and physical collectibles; with Beanie Babies the buyer can keep them safe in a location of their choosing, and even take out insurance on them so you get your money's worth in the event of a fire or burglary.) So what would it matter that it can't be forged if it also doesn't do what it's supposed to do in the first place? You're out hundreds, if not millions, of dollars for a string of code that isn't even human-readable. The tokens themselves would be far less valuable to people if they understood that, because without the sentimental value the only other utility for the token is selling it off to someone else.

(I mean, I'm sure there's at least one person in the world who would want to maintain a collection of non-human-readable code, but whoever they are, without the associated image it'd be a whole lot easier to convince other people that said code wasn't worth the price they paid for it.)",260,hv6sjda,t1_hv6fq42,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sh9x9g/whats_going_on_with_video_game_companies/hv6sjda/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

So the example of selling part of the moon/star registry, yeah it's stupid, but it's a stupid idea regardless of whether it would be an NFT or not, but instead lets look at a useful example like Pokemon cards.

Reddit_Comments,HuskieMuffenz,"Thank you for reading my comment! I hope you got something out of it. I just wanted to give some background as to why they exist and what the intention of them was Vitalik Buterin (guy who made Ethereum) and friends laid out a roadmap for what they envisioned the purpose of their work being.

(Read the original idea from them here: https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)

I find anything related to blockchain fascinating and I have loved watching it grow in mature over the past decade or so. I studied cryptography quite extensively in college. I currently work as a software engineer for a large company that offers financial services to people globally. I feel like my professional life has given me a lot more background knowledge and context to what these are actually trying to do. 

Ethereum is 6 years old. It is brand spanking new. In 10 years it will probably work very differently than it does now. 

(Actually in a short period of time it will change considerably in order to increased transaction volume and decrease gas prices.
 https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)

Lots of people have said I'm trying to encourage people to put their money into a cryptocurrency or NFTs for my own personal gain. This is absolutely not the case. I have nothing invested in Ethereum. I do not want to encourage anyone to do so. I don't know if it is a bad idea or a good idea. I just think it's a really cool idea from a technical standpoint.

From what I can tell, the reddit hivemind has decided that NFTs are bad and anything related to NFTs is bad. They are a scam. Anyone who thinks NFTs are not evil is wrong and a scam artist. I've seen a lot of people trying to give a technical perspective on these and just get downvoted to oblivion.

With that the hive mind is correct in that a lot of companies are trying to leverage these as a way to extract more value from their consumers. This is sad.

Reddit_Comments,DrHemroid,"Answer: NFTs are the more palatable version of Play to Earn, which major game publishers want to start adding to their games. https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2021/12/13/play-to-earn-gaming-is-driving-nft-and-crypto-growth

The question that should be asked is: why are the studios pushing for Play to Earn?

Play to Earn in theory is the idea that by playing a game, you have the potential to earn real world money. In practice, Play to Earn is a way to prey on human psychology to get people addicted to ""playing"" a game for  a low payout, similar to a gambling mindset. There are currently hundreds of Play to Earn ""games"" available now that are simply used as vehicles to serve as many ads to users as possible. The ""gameplay"" is typically on the scale of copy pasted minigames you've already seen from mobile games or browser based flash games. What keeps people playing isn't the joy of playing, it's the financial insensitive and addiction.

I wish there were published studies on this topic, but it appears that this is too new. I could only find articles about games being designed to be more addictive, and one factor is the idea that virtual goods = physical goods in our minds, and adding a real world value / NFT to game items serves as a way to further cement this idea, and thus make make games more addictive. https://gamequitters.com/are-video-games-addictive/

So the answer to original question, why are game developers rushing to add NFTs to their games? It's because they see NFTs as a way to add Play to Earn to their games without facing universal backlash from the gaming community. There will be a lot of backlash from gamers due to how despised and ridiculed NFTs currently are, but now they can hide behind the vocal fans of NFTs.

And the reasons game developers want to add Play to Earn to their games is simple: make the games more addictive, make more people want to play your game, and make the people playing your games want to play longer. In addition, there will likely be a fee for every NFT sold on the marketplace which goes directly to the game developers, meaning from the game developer perspective, NFTs are simply a source of increased revenue.",369,hv5whhb,t3_sh9x9g,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sh9x9g/whats_going_on_with_video_game_companies/hv5whhb/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Reddit_Comments,HuskieMuffenz,"That's an excellent point! It's much ado about nothing if nobody cares at all. For the NFT pipe dream to be fully realized it would require most of the world's legislatures to see a specific blockchain as essentially the US patent and copyright office. You would need lawyers to physically enforce it.

I personally think NFTs in their current state are pretty useless and require years of work before they can mature into something that adds value to the world. I have nothing invested in them and I don't want to encourage anyone to allocate their resources towards them. I studied cryptology extensively in college and find that whole subject area very interesting. I currently work for a big company that provides a lot of financial services. The goal of my comment was to give some perspective into what the people who were actually building these are thinking.

I think the real long-term mainstream applications of blockchain will revolve around integrating itself into pre-existing financial services to make the process more efficient. Most economic zones are currently exploring a central bank digital currency, think government issued stable coins.

I've also heard a lot of interesting ideas around cryptocurrencies being able to provide a lot of the same financial services that people in more developed nations enjoy. If you don't have a stable bank these are very attractive as a supplement. Those people do not think NFTs are attractive.

That's where you're losing it, there are no *actual* collectors. Just people flipping NFTs.

Imagine if the entire real estate market was house flippers. No one needs to buy a house to live in, everyone purchasing a house is **only** going to list it for sale for a higher price.

Reddit_Comments,BluegrassGeek,"&gt;But the part I don't get is why would any real person then buy THIS rare pepe when you could just create your own version that's 1 pixel different?  
&gt;  
&gt;Like you said Bitcoin is limited by its own algorithms, no one can just pull a Bitcoin out of thin air. But, anyone can copy and edit an image to be unique

The supporters are trying to conflate the idea of ""no one can just pull a Bitcoin out of thin air"" with NFTs. 

Both depend on the blockchain, aka a digital public ledger. The idea is that someone mines a Bitcoin or mints an NFT, that digitial item is entered into the blockchain under their wallet. They can then transfer it to others, and the blockchain records it every step along its journey.

But a Bitcoin isn't actually unique: like any fiat currency, it's just a line on the ledger. Likewise, the NFT isn't actually an object to be possessed, it's just a fancy web bookmark pointing to the server which hosts the original image. Neither of them hold any intrinsic value, it's all in ""whoever has this digital ID in their digital wallet can trade it for real-world money.""

As you point out, the art itself isn't protected in any way. The NFT ""certificate"" just shows that you hold that token from the original minting. If someone else mints an NFT of the exact same image, well, the two of you can argue on the Internet which token is ""more authentic,"" but there's no regulatory body to oversee the value of either.

NFT bros will claim that the first minting is ""obviously"" the valuable one, but there's absolutely nothing to back that up. All NFTs are just worth whatever someone will trade for them, and there's zero technical system to prevent making copies &amp; minting new NFTs of the same art file.

This is the Achilles heel of NFTs: with no system of digital rights management (DRM), NFTs have no protection for the investor. Cryptobros will argue that the ledger itself is sufficient and people just need to learn how to do the research for themselves to prevent being scammed... but ultimately, this ""you're on your own"" attitude is the core weakness of NFTs. The NFT cheerleaders are so convinced of their own intelligence that they refuse to see the fatal flaws in the system as flaws at all, because then the whole house of cards would come tumbling down and their ""investments"" would be worthless.

NFTs only provide value so long as they keep pulling new recruits into the scheme.

Reddit_Comments,BluegrassGeek,"It's one of the major thoughts behind crypto, yes. The true-believers think that having this decentralized ledger solves all the problems of ""trust"" involved with banks, governments, etc. Since you can just check the blockchain to verify the transaction, you can ""see for yourself"" who owns the NFT/coin.

... but it's all based on this magical thinking that, somehow, seeing the transaction is *good enough* to verify ownership. It's very libertarian ""possession is 9/10ths of the law"" thinking. The idea is that only stupid people could be tricked into transferring their coins/NFTs to a scam account, and of course *they* are too smart to ever make such a mistake.

Which ignores all the mistakes people are making constantly with blockchain transactions &amp; scams. And that brings us to the other group behind blockchain: the ones who recognize it doesn't really work, but think they can get rich off the true-believers.

The problem is that you can't easily tell the difference between the two. The post above could be from someone who actually believes in blockchain, or it could be from someone who just wants to make money off suckers &amp; is repeating the ""blockchain solves 3rd party trust problems"" mantra.

An NFT is like a crypto token, where each token is different. You can make whatever you want from this basis. It seems that Ubisoft will propose NFTs as a pointless achievement unlocker.

Popular applications are avatars (CryptoPunks, BAYC, MAYC etc.), metaverse (The Sandbox, Decentraland, Cryptovoxels), Art (Artblock), Decentralized Finance (known as DeFi) but also music, photography etc.

About claiming it is similar to a claim on moon land. I think it is an incorrect comparison. For collectibles, NFT strongly depends on the collection it is in. As such, it would NOT be the same as a random guy offering the SAME image NFT. The avatar often give right to some kind of membership status (that is the case for BAYC), and they are often interoperable, meaning that it should be recognized by any web3.0 platform.

Reddit_Comments,LouisKI,"Great summary. However, I think it is important to point out that what is wrong is not NFTs per se, but what greedy big corporates such as Ubisoft want to get out of this technology. 

One of NFTs goals is to move the world towards Web3.0, or some sort of decentralized internet where everything do not work for google or facebook. Ironically enough, facebook has been one of the first big tech to see this coming and they have come as far as to rebrand completely to shift their focus towards web3.0, in an attempt to set themselves as a trend leader, and a future market leader. Note that this is strongly against Web3.0 very principle.

Now, we see another adverse effect of NFTs on the gaming industry, with yet again another greedy company that wants to make more money by riding on that trend. It is not sure what this will turn to, there are enough NFT enthusiasts in the gaming industry that would just blindly approve and support this ""technological innovation/initiative"".

Recently, some game companies have announced plans to incorporate NFTs into their games. Gamers, who generally tend to overall be concerned about the trend toward ""monetization over fun"" see this as yet another thing they don't really want that's going to make the games they want to play more about extracting value from gamers, and less about making great games.

Some game companies have responded by saying, in essence, ""Wow we had no idea people felt that way and we won't do that, sorry,"" while others have said, in essence, ""The people who think this is a bad idea haven't thought about it as much as we have and are wrong.""

I don't think NFTs are going to work out, but the dream is that they do slightly more than provide an in-game peer-to-peer marketplace (they are totally unnecessary for that.) 

The dream is for a system where digital ownership is determined by a blockchain. And then this system is not the subset of a game; rather, games are a subset of this system. Today we all use the free and open internet where everyone can copy a jpeg without consequence. But in the dreams of an NFT future, we all use a closed and controlled internet where every jpeg has a one-true-owner.

No positives? 

I feel like this explanation hasn't been made with all of the facts and a deeper understanding. Rather it is biased because of the craze dumb people fall for.

All your points are negative. 

-different block chain tech doesn't require the same amount of processing like Bitcoin. There are far more efficient ones that don't cause supply issues for gamers(gpu etc)(mostly affected by covid supply)

-allowing minting of digital assets can open up the development community to more content. Freelance developers can license their work for profit. They spend high skilled hours creating it...it's worth money. Devs make 100k a year on a team....what could you do if you are a really good freelance?

-pay to earn models are already frowned upon and drastically hurt...look what happened to dice and starwars. Laws have already forced the model to change. Nft and gaming won't get around that.

-its not a scam. The underlying technology is substantially more efficient if widely adopted than centralized applications.



The overall idea is to sell digital assets and license products of work for use. That can be art, digital assets(in games), motion tracking animations, website code, stock trading with instant settlement...the list goes on as to how an NFT (token... alpha numeric string....a nonce...used once) can be used to verify a contract.

Nfts have a high carbon footprint, that's bad.


What I've seen talked about as a best case scenario


You have a group of developers that commit to offer an nft together.  These developers create a unique skin, a full body tiger costume for example.  They agree that this skin is in every game they make.  They agree that every time time the nft is sold, they each get some portion of that sales price.  The nft is sold for $10k to start.

- NFT minters require a lot of the same hardware that gamers use, only on a larger scale. This drives the price of that equipment up, meaning that they become less accessible to gamers.
- Game publishers and their shareholders will be motivated by the easy profit. Since minting NFTs of your already existing assets is a lot cheaper than funding the development of a full quality game, gamers fear that the companies will divert resources and develop games of lower quality, though probably at the same price as their existing games.
- Also, incorporating NFTs into gaming is essentially adding a yet another predatory practice for gaming companies to exploit whales and other people with poor impulse control. This is especially bad if they implement a ‚Äúpay to earn‚Äù model. Lure players with the prospect of making money by gaming, giving them crumbs while the company takes a disproportionately large amount of the profit.

Yes, but the main difference is that a game developer could tie the certificate to an in-game asset, because they control the game and its development. So what they're selling isn't a total fabrication. 

They could sell you a widget that has value in a game, and if they make it an NFT, then you could sell it to another player if you wanted to. But whatever real-world worth it has is entirely tied in to how the devs incorporate it into the game.

Reddit_Comments,donespapo,"Answer: think about it this way. No one ‚Äúowns‚Äù the moon. Yet someone can try to sell you land on the moon, and give you a nice little certificate to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that you do. You‚Äôre not getting any actual land, just the certificate that only other certificate owners (and the grifters who sold it to you) would consider valid. The grifters just need to cover the costs of a business that makes paper and/or pdf certificates, which is easy since THEY didn‚Äôt have to actually buy land on the moon.

NFTs are essentially unique ‚Äúreceipts‚Äù that are often linked to digital goods, such as (in this case) video game achievements. It doesn‚Äôt make you the ‚Äúowner‚Äù of that achievement, since plenty of players could reach the same achievement. What is unique is the ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù, ie a ‚Äúnon-fungible token‚Äù that cannot be duplicated. It‚Äôs a receipt that grants you bragging rights to the receipt. 

Now, normally you can sell NFTs for crypto, and buying prices are relatively arbitrary. People will pay ridiculous amounts of money to claim that they ‚Äúown‚Äù a meme, a piece of digital art, etc. Creating (called ‚Äúminting‚Äù) NFTs, on the other hand can therefore be very profitable if you can convince some poor sucker that it‚Äôs valuable. This makes it very profitable as long as people keep falling for the scam.

Reddit_Comments,Tony_Chu,"In order to generate and maintain a block chain, there needs to be a lot of computational time spent.  The quickest way to perform all of the calculations quickly in order to produce as much as possible is to use fast processors, including GPUs.  

This uses a lot of electricity.  Since there is a lot of money in crypto (speculative, scammy, utilitarian, and otherwise), some outfits around the world have set up voraciously energy consuming warehouses full of many linked processors.  Additionally, literally millions of people around the globe are running processors hot 24/7 in order to try to mine crypto and create NFTs.  

It has stressed the manufacturing and supply chain for processors world wide, affecting everything from car manufacturing to the availability of PS5 consoles.  

And all of the energy consumption requires energy production.  Despite all of our growth towards green energy in recent years, as a species the majority of our energy production is still very very impactive in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  All of this crypto has very appreciatively moved the needle. 

If human contributions to climate change are real (they are, but that's a separate conversation), then crypto is fast becoming a major contributor.  

All that said - NFTs are potentially the scammiest and least utilitarian of the crypto offerings (besides, you know, like *literal* scam tokens).  The people evangelizing NFTs are trying to make money off of a trend, but when you scrutinize the ""value"" of NFTs as they articulate it - there isn't anything there because at the end of the day is really *is* just a trend, and nothing else.

Reddit_Comments,gogilitan,"Answer: You will never see criticism of NFTs in NFT friendly space because the value of NFTs is entirely based on speculation. ""Community leaders"" have a financial incentive to squash all criticism and promote wider adoption.

Skeptics are told they don't understand or are just upset that they missed the initial boat. The ingroup is told to hodl with diamondhands and not give in to FUD, and if they do that then everyone will get rich. Anyone concerned gets ostracized or banned.

The same can be said about gamestop. As a company, it's largely irrelevant (brick and mortar store in a digital age). Maybe some day it'll do something of note again, but right now (since the GME stock hype has long since been left behind) the vast majority of people couldn't give less of a shit about it.

I say this as someone who's actually very pro-crypto... there are some significant differences.

Ethereum, the main type of crypto all of these NFTs are based on, runs on something called ""proof of work"" to ""mine"" Ethereum coins.

""Proof of work"" basically means randomly guessing the answers to very, very complex math problems. That's a gross oversimplification (it's not exactly random guessing, etc), but it's close enough. 

Because of this, to ""mine"" (produce more coins) Ethereum, you need to spend a lot of electricity making these guesses. The amount of electricity used far, *far* exceeds the computer's normal electrical usage.

Reddit_Comments,ApeWiddaCape,"Answer: The consensus indeed *is* that NFTs are at best a joke, and at worst scams. The GME hype is absolutely no different, but Apes are bagholders.

What has happened is that Gamestop shareholders on Reddit (""Apes"") have been spending *months* trying to figure out what Gamestop's forward prospectus really is. See, Chewy founder Ryan Cohen took over as Chair of Gamestop, with a vague intention to pivot Gamestop to an e-commerce/culture oriented gaming store. Cohen is somewhat famously cagey about his plans, but has a strong reputation in some circles from his work with Chewy.

Understand, Apes are bagholders. A year ago there was the famous ""squeeze"". Bagholders from that ""squeeze"" have since elaborated a vast meta-conspiracy theory claiming that Wall Street is manipulating the stock price etc. Gamestop stock had sold for over $300 again back in May/June, and has turbulently declined ever since. The volume profile statistics of GME stock suggest the average cost basis for retail shareholders is likely $190 at least. So the Apes are desperate to justify why their stock is worth what they paid. Their ""movement"" has a staunch culture of not selling their shares in protest of alleged Wall Street malfeasance.

Gamestop has been advertising jobs for blockchain related talent. Apes have thus constructed various theories, some of which are *absolutely insane*, regarding Gamestop's blockchain aspirations.

So, they hype the idea that Gamestop is going to have an NFT marketplace that will become dominant, even revolutionary, in the space. The various ideas that get hyped are too many to cover, but they all involve the use of the Loopring ethereum platform.

The issue is that, while Gamestop no doubt plans to do *something* in the blockchain/NFT space, they have virtually no transparency. Their shareholders have no idea what they are doing. NFTs are derided by the gaming community at large, and completely mocked by financial analysts/pundits as a fad. For example, Wedbush's Michael Pachter, a long time gaming industry analyst, has stated Gamestop has ""no role"" in the future of NFTs, and that the corporate office simply lacks the relationships and goodwill with developers to execute anything major.

Apes hype *all kinds* of extravagant things they believe Gamestop could achieve, but, frankly, it is nonsense. Gamestop Corp has *never* endorsed anything Apes speculate.  The company is still unprofitable. The share price is down 60% in the last 9 weeks. Apes are desperate to foment a new wave of retail FOMO action. They are cult-like in their delusional hive-mind thinking. They are also gaining attention [with Q Anon](https://iili.io/lWDSZN.jpg) due to their conspiratorial thinking about Wall Street.

Reddit_Comments,TitaniumDragon,"Answer: Crypto is fundamentally a pyramid scheme. Cryptocurrency has no actual value - unlike national fiat money, it isn't supported by a tax base, and unlike, say, gold, there is no physical commodity associated with it. It isn't even useful as currency because the transaction speed is too low.

As such, its value is entirely dependent on how much money people are willing to dump into it - the only way to make money off of crypto is for new suckers to come along and pay even more money for it.

And they're running out of suckers.

NFTs drew more attention to crypto, and crypto in general has been drawing greater regulatory scrutiny in the last year or so. And people haven't been liking what they've been seeing. People are becoming more active in attacking cryptocurrency for the pyramid scheme that it is. At the same time, NFTs drew money from suckers away from standard crypto markets.

On top of all this, the supposed ""value"" of cryptocurrency is actually held up by fraud, primarily committed by Tether and similar groups, which are under criminal investigation for market manipulation... because they are engaging in market manipulation and fraud.

Many companies that experimented with accepting crypto dumped it because it is terrible as currency, removing what little real-world value it ever had.

So you're looking at a pyramid scheme - which is dependent on always pulling in more people with more money - no longer doing so to the same extent, as people are growing increasingly wary of it. The people who have been involved in doing very illegal things in crypto are under legal pressure, and it has no real world value backing it up. On top of that, the scam is being diluted by a new related one.",292,hufdced,t3_sd8m42,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sd8m42/what_is_up_with_crypto_currencies_collapse_over/hufdced/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,public,0

Using those *centralized services* to act as the middle man between clients and the blockchain requires trust in the groups that run those services. Trust that they won't steal your information, and trust that they won't serve falsified data.

Game items are one of the worst use cases yet - the game server is 100% authoritative on what the NFT actually means, there's no benefit to using them. Nothing about how NFTs work would magically compel a developer to make them tradeable if they didn't want to, and likewise NFTs aren't required if a game dev did want tradeable items.

And most players actively don't want real-money purchasing of gameplay items in the first place since it incentivizes pay-to-win design.

Reddit_Comments,TavisNamara,"The short answer: Ask the guys it [already happened to](https://www.morganlinton.com/found-a-random-nft-in-your-wallet-interacting-with-it-could-be-a-big-mistake/) (note: this is an NFT-positive site talking about this, not anyone actively against crypto).

The long answer:

Alright, just like with anything crypto, this is kinda complicated. First thing: An NFT is not a jpeg. Nor is it an image link. It is a receipt denoting a string. Now, the most common string for this to be at current is an image link, but this string can be ***anything*** that's sufficiently small. This includes code.

Second: On interaction with an NFT- trying to transfer or sell it, mostly- this code can somehow execute. I'm not 100% clear on this, honestly, but it has happened a lot, so... Gotta be working somehow, as shown in the link and endorsed by dozens and dozens of people who lost everything.

Third: There is literally nothing preventing someone from dropping an NFT into your crypto wallet if it's publicly listed and in the open. They can just hand you anything. Like, say, a picture of your home, publicly listed and immutable on the Blockchain (okay, the picture's too big to actually be on the Blockchain, but the link to the picture is now there) and now permanently tied to your wallet. Also it's attached to code that steals your shit.

Interact or don't, you're fucked, and there's a time bomb now sitting in your wallet waiting to steal everything you have. Guess you should get a new wallet which the Blockchain will advertise openly because all the transfers will show on the Blockchain so they'll know exactly where you transferred everything to and where to send the NFT of your house next time.",274,i2nybnd,t1_i2nv6cp,/r/news/comments/tr9zj9/blockchain_project_ronin_hit_by_615_million/i2nybnd/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

Reddit_Comments,flanderguitar,"LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Blockchain project Ronin said on Tuesday that hackers stole cryptocurrency now worth almost $615 million from its systems, in what would be one of the largest cryptocurrency heists on record.

The project said that unidentified hackers on March 23 stole some 173,600 ether tokens and 25.5 million USD Coin tokens. At current exchange rates, the stolen funds are worth $615 million, but they were worth some $540 million at the time of the attack.

This makes it the second-largest crypto theft on record, according to blockchain analysis firm Elliptic.

Ronin is used to power the popular online game Axie Infinity, which uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and is the biggest NFT collection by all-time sales volume, according to NFT market tracker CryptoSlam.

Ronin said in a blog post that the hacker had used stolen private keys - the passwords needed to access crypto funds - to make off with the funds.

Ronin said it had discovered the hack on Tuesday. ""We are working directly with various government agencies to ensure the criminals get brought to justice,"" it said, adding that it was discussing with Axie Infinity how to ensure no users' funds were lost.

Ronin's users are unable to withdraw or deposit funds on the network, it said.

Ronin did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via Twitter. It said it was working with major blockchain tracker Chainalysis to trace the stolen funds. Most of the funds are still in the hacker's digital wallet, Ronin said.

Hacks have long plagued crypto platforms.

The cryptocurrency arm of Jump Trading said last month it had restored more than $320 million to crypto platform Wormhole after the decentralised finance site was hit with one of the largest crypto heists on record. read more

Last August, hackers behind likely the biggest ever digital coin heist returned nearly all of the $610 million-plus they stole from the DeFi site Poly Network. read more

In 2018, digital tokens worth some $530 million were stolen from Tokyo-based platform Coincheck. Mt. Gox, another Japanese exchange, collapsed in 2014 after hackers stole half a billion dollars of crypto.

Ronin is developed by Singapore-based game studio Sky Mavis, which owns Axie Infinity. Sky Mavis does not give contact details on its website. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via LinkedIn.",380,i2lco1h,t3_tr9zj9,/r/news/comments/tr9zj9/blockchain_project_ronin_hit_by_615_million/i2lco1h/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

As far as crypto, it's the future of all money. There will be digital dollars implemented globally over the next few decades, they won't use the energy-intense ""mining"" and won't need ""proof of work"" since the government-run servers will be the only authenticators - and it's going to be pretty dystopian in general once that happens.

Every real dollar that moves in the economy will be tracked, it'll either be a digital dollar or a credit card, either way it'll leave a paper trail.

If you want to authenticate the source of a video, bog standard cryptographic signing is plenty. Of course you still have to decide whether you trust the owner of the signing key.

The flip side of that, non-repudiation (that someone who signed something can't claim they didn't) is also solvable by having a redundant public key store. A blockchain ledger for public keys could perhaps be useful here, sure. But that isn't solving the problem of deepfakes in any sense.

Reddit_Comments,BrutusJunior,"&gt;If nobody trades crypto it has no value.

Correct. This is true for all commodities.

&gt;It requires constant addition of users to grow in value.

Again correct, but not necessarily relevant.

&gt;Crypto is a scam and a grift

Saying things don't make them true. A scam is a 'trick'. Unless you consider all commodities to be scams, crypto isn't inherently a scam. Now of course, the concept of cryptocurrency can be used for scams, as we see with many NFTs and for example beetcooneeeeeeeeeect! wasuwasuwasuuuup!.

&gt;Those who stand to offload the bags to you in exchange for your money breathlessly tell you how great the opportunity is, and it just takes a small financial investment. They make out like bandits, while most everyone else is left holding the bag.

I ask because just clicking to view an nft should not be able to execute any kind of process that would need wallet-level authorization. I thought it sounded like Waka may have left something out. Here's what I found about this type of scam. 

&gt;The NFT itself, and the airdrop, was not the source of the issue. Instead, once an NFT had been gifted to a potential victim, they would view it -- and then a pop-up would trigger, requesting a signature to connect to a wallet. A secondary signature request prompt would then appear, and if accepted, could grant attackers access to an unwitting user's wallet, funds, and more.

Reddit_Comments,AshleyNeku,"Blockchains aren't concerned with ownership, transactions are considered valid as long as the rules are followed and an NFT is traded correctly. Phishing attacks and schemes to trick people into trading or giving away an NFT are very common because it cannot be undone by anybody. Picture any scam where people try and convince you to give them money. Now imagine the same thing with an NFT and realize that if it's done, the original owner has absolutely no recourse. The perpetrators will never have consequences. 

Dan Olsen does a great analysis of NFTs in general and their ability to perpetuate schemes in his YouTube video Line Goes Up, I definitely recommend it if you want a rudimentary understanding of NFTs (which, you should, at least to protect yourself as they become more popular and less obvious).",137,hxxdgfn,t1_hxtwyh3,/r/news/comments/sxt93p/opensea_confirms_hacker_stole_nfts_worth_125m/hxxdgfn/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

These photos that are circulating around aren‚Äôt worth a damn next to the actual fundamental tech behind NFTs. Case in point. Today if you buy a house, in order to ensure your title and deed is your own, you need a title search, a real estate lawyer, a closing, and so much more. Why? Because you can get scammed and many people have. Especially in areas like the Catskills which have checkered title history. Tomorrow, your deed will be an NFT and ownership of that unique deed will transfer to you instantly. Without the lawyers, the title search agency or any of that. There can only be one deed and it can never be duplicated. And it has to be validated by multiple decentralized PC, not one clearinghouse which may or may not have your best interest at heart.

Reddit_Comments,Iamjacksplasmid,"If they bought with cash at the peak and the market corrects, they won't walk away. They'll just be unwilling to sell or rent at a loss.

It's a different crisis than 2008, but that doesn't make it any less severe. It's just that the people hit the hardest in this case are going to be the lower and middle class...renters who can't afford to keep moving every year when their lease is up and their rent increases another 30%, and small landlords who can't afford maintenance and property taxes on houses whose continually increasing value leaves them with no choice but to sell to larger holding companies or foreign investors.

You're right that this is different. 2008 led to a market collapse, a huge transition of wealth from the poor to the rich, and a general distrust in large institutions that resulted in bullshit populist pyramid schemes like crypto and NFTs. This will lead to a homelessness crisis, an even larger transition of wealth from the poor to the rich, and an enormous swelling populist rage the likes of which we have never seen.

You can't just keep taking people's homes and jobs and property and expect that to not catch up with us socially. Eventually there's going to be a reckoning.

Reddit_Comments,TavisNamara,"Not really. Amazon stock is actually connected to something. That is, Amazon. It is a piece of the corporation. The value may fluctuate, but it's tied to something very real, if intangible. In the future, Amazon may even offer dividends- a tangible compensation for ownership based on the profit of the company. But regardless, there is a real thing that it's connected to, and confers control of that portion of the company. I'm a very, very minor stockholder (a few hundred in two companies- almost nothing, really) myself and get a letter every once in a while instructing me on how to submit my votes for all sorts of things and, were I a larger shareholder, I could have significant influence on the company. And the regulators and governments back the idea that my shares mean something, and the whole system acknowledges that yes, I own a portion- tiny as it is- of those companies. But crypto and NFTs are, by their nature, not really anything? Especially crypto. It's all a fiction that has value because we say it has value. There's no company with tangible assets out there. There's no regulation stating there's a connection. There's nothing but a crypto wallet stating you technically have a thing. What is that thing? Not much. What good is it if the creators do a rug pull? Useless. What happens if nobody's buying? You lose.

That said, much of the value of stocks is indeed fictional- but again, it *is* tied to something real that can't just spontaneously vanish. Which gives it a critical level of stability and base value that crypto and NFTs can literally never have.

Also, for the record, I fucking hate the companies I own shares in and always vote against them being assholes.

True. 

However, since crypto/NFTs are apt to capital gains as they are seen as a security not a currency, the losses on any investment can offset gains. This is especially true in crypto, you could have NFTs that ""make money"" and NFTs that are ""losses"" but the offset or margin between those is only what is taxed.

Additionally, buying them for any business purpose can be an expense that lowers tax burden.  

Buying an NFT where the funds go to another company that is partly owned by you or associates, that is taxed differently and not directly, can move taxation or lower it.

There are many more tricks with taxation that people are using other than just losses.",128,hxu5uoc,t1_hxtzuq2,/r/news/comments/sxt93p/opensea_confirms_hacker_stole_nfts_worth_125m/hxu5uoc/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

Reddit_Comments,chenz1989,"It is my personal opinion that this is just the market correcting itself for the past couple of years. 

The US treasury has been printing trillions of dollars since Obama. This accelerated under Trump and even more under Biden. Many governments across the world has done the same due to pandemic related issues.

What we're seeing is the market correcting for huge influx of cash out of literally nowhere. And because most countries have only very recently started opening up, most of that cash has gone into investment vessels, thus the ballooning of housing prices and things like NFT speculation. (To say nothing of how all this extra cash is not equally distributed)

We're in for some extremely big problems.",118,hxrj8v2,t1_hxqn6c2,/r/news/comments/sx6b0o/rents_reach_insane_levels_across_us_with_no_end/hxrj8v2/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Clbull,"That seems like a big number, until you realise it's a little over $3 per American.

I'm not gonna downplay the figures. Dating scams are absolutely everywhere, especially if you frequent an online dating app. Worst part is that the companies who run these sites know what scam and and spam-ridden shitshows their platforms are but will do little to police it, because moderation costs money and why do something that will mainly benefit the free users when you want to make their experiences so miserable that they'll cough up triple the price of a WoW subscription for a premium account out of desperation?

No seriously, go on Okcupid or Facebook Dating right now and start swiping right. Tell me how many Asian or African women you match with that spoof their location and actually live halfway across the world looking for a long distance boyfriend and a means to a green card. Use Google Lens, Tineye or Google Image Search and tell me how many female users are using fake profile pictures they stole from an influencer's social media profiles. Now tell me how many female users are e-models using the platform to plug their OF or premium Snapchats.

Really thankful that I'm not single anymore and that I haven't been gullible enough to fall for some of these scams. If I match with a woman and she acts suspiciously clingy then starts trying to convince me to invest in some cryptocurrency or NFT scam, I'll block her. Same if she immediately wants to go to sexy talk and tries to talk me into mutually masturbating on cam. I know I'll either be scammed or blackmailed out of my money.

This shit is why the manosphere has grown in size and influence. Dating is so hard for men that they've become the #1 target for dating scams. You almost never hear about women being swindled by male con-artists, to the point where the rare cases like Simon Leviev get a fucking Netflix documentary made about them...",333,hx330wv,t3_st18fg,/r/news/comments/st18fg/fbi_americans_lost_1_billion_to_romance_scams_in/hx330wv/,2,news,t5_2qh3l,,,0

Reddit_Comments,YellowB,"Imagine you spend your entire life being a good person. You spend the weekends helping out at the homeless shelter. During the day time you tutor the disabled kids at the local YMCA. You eat healthy and exercise regularly so that you can meet the right person one day and start a family. Pictures of your wedding day, having your first kid, seeing them graduate all flash in your mind through out the day. Why just yesterday you made your last payment and have finally paid off your student loan.   

 To celebrate you offered to meet a friend at the coffee shop, that you really like and finally have the heart to ask out. They agree to meet you that day. You get on your bike and drive it to get to the Cafe. After about 3 miles of riding your bike you have only 3 more minutes to reach your destination.  You ride your bike over the bridge, when all of the sudden you feel the entire Earth start shifting. You have no idea what's going on but you hop off your bike to keep your balance. Almost immediately that flat surface is now almost at a 45 degree incline.  You grab whatever you can to hang on as you wsee your bike slide backwards into a gap in the pavement that is widening. You shout for help but you know that no one will be able to help you now that you're 60 feet in the air. You wonder how any of this can happen to you. You've been a good person your entire life and were just about to start a relationship.   

Seconds later your fingers give out from the pain of holding on for so long. You finally give in and look to the right where the control tower is. The last few seconds of your life you see the guy in charge of the bridge on his phone, trying to browse /r/Wallstreetbets to get tips on which NFT to invest his life savings on.

Reddit_Comments,Clever_Word_Play,"With all your knowledge how companies operate you have nothing to do with operate, you must be a big wig somewhere...

Ticket master has a massive infrastructure, and isn't the most user friendly. NFL and college teams basically use them out of necessity. This came directly from interviews with ticketing people at 2 NFL teams and 2 college programs.

If it was so easy to undercut on cost, and TM just does it arbitrarily, why has someone beat them out? There are 100s of ticketing companies. I think the problem is you are only thinking of the secondary market ticket costs, which sure are arbitrary, not primary market relations with venues which is where ticket companies actually make money. For example Ticket Master is the official ticket partner for the Houston Texans. I also bet when I said user friendly, you thought I was talking about me or you buying a ticket...

The problem with implementation of using blockchain is the process has to be fully digital, which could work for NFL level(Texans just did that) but you have to test it much lower level as a new company before an NFL team trusts you, where fully digital might not work for people going to shows. Lot of concert venues people still like physical tickets to keep.

As for point of sale. I havent looked into other than talk with the guys from Topl. They ran the numbers not me, the problem holding them back is their system requires an App to work, and average person doesn't want another app just to buy a coffee.

I absolutely think crypto currency and NFT as investments are stupid. But saying because it's been around for X years it's worthless. New programs take forever to be implemented. I work for a fortune 1000 company and we just got Microsoft suite 2016....

Reddit_Comments,Tech_AllBodies,"&gt; 50 Million users is a tall order. Especially if they want them using their VR/AR stuff for facebook related stuff, and not some other companies game.

Well their users are over 10 million now (at least over 10 million HMDs sold), and rising exponentially.

So, with Zuck's guided 10-15 year time horizon, 50+ million seems essentially guaranteed.

They also don't necessarily need people to buy stuff directly from them, particularly if they blow past 100+ million users.

Much like Valve/Steam, if they have a lot of users which use their store, they can make a lot of money just through taking cuts from transactions and sales of other people's games.

&gt; What facebook should be investing in is making VR and other technologies usable for non techies. As you said Sony already has VR, and Microsoft could easily enter the space . Both companies often have proven track records in making virtual entertainment products.

I mean, the Quest 2 is quite a low barrier for entry, in terms of tech-savvy-ness.

&gt; It would be one thing if Zuck wanted to pivot hard to making VR/AR way less Niche and corner the market, but as it stands now it seems message to investors is some VR Chat + Roblox + Maybe some NFT crap. Internal Reports from the Meta Division are not promising. It also is a huge gamble for what ultimately will be an entertainment product.

But they are doing this? The Quest 2 is $299 and all-in-one.

And it was not long ago that MS/Xbox was a laughing stock for their mis-steps in entertainment.

Reddit_Comments,needlzor,"The general idea of the Metaverse, at least how Zuckerberg explained it in interviews and stuff, is to build a general infrastructure for connected applications in VR. For example right now you have your computer, and it allows you to open a web browser and jump from site to site - what he wants to build is something equivalent except that your VR headset is the computer and instead of site to site you jump from VR app to VR app, with some way of maintaining a consistent ""identity"" (which is where the NFT grifters will try to sell their blockchain garbage).

Why would Facebook care? Some people will tell you they want to control the ""Metaverse"" but I think it sounds unlikely, because it would be technically very difficult to do so and would impair its growth due to Facebook's terrible image. Personally, my pet theory is that Zuck wants to position Meta as an identity provider for connected VR apps. You buy your very affordable *Meta* headset, you create your *Meta* identity, and that's all Zuck needs to build what is more or less the Google Ads of VR. Since the Metaverse is based on the principle of having a consistent identity across all of its apps (for reasons nobody has managed to explain to me so far) it gives them an reason to track you, and since eye tracking is necessary to do foveated rendering (which allows you to get better graphics for less computational power) it gives them a reason to track where you're looking.

Another theory is that they are trying to tap into the remote work market. You can barely get half the people to use Zoom and Teams properly, how on earth are you gonna get them to use something more complicated?

Maybe a far fetched conspiracy theory. Maybe they are dog whistling to the crypto folks even though they are pitching for businesses and regular consumers. Virtual BS like NFTs is something a lot of these folks like to speculate on.

Can I ask you a question? Do you think capitilism is working? 

NFT and crypto are killing the planet for profit, businesses and government are working together to take our rights like the train union that legally can't strike or the judge that tried to keep those doctors from taking better jobs, Facebook is the largest news distributor and they're a private business about to sell real estate in cyber space, we have to get our medical bills paid on gofundme.

Is it a successful society structure when hundreds of thousands live on the streets and die of preventable diseases? Is it a win if some children starve to death or be slaves for chocolate farms for our profits?

Reddit_Comments,Squirrel_Inner,"Wow, dude sure likes to talk. Maybe next time you send someone that link, mention that he doesn't start on his point with NFTs until the 40min mark.  
He really could have split that up into 3 separate vids, or maybe just been more succinct instead of rambling on and on.

Here's his main points (as far as I could manage to understand) with my replies:  
	1) NFTs are bad because crypto uses them and crypto is bad.   
	My response: NFTs don't have to use crypto. Yes, there are a lot of scams going on, that's true for literally everything. Following hype is bad (dumb), but there is more to it than that.

	2) Current NFT marketplaces are bad and there are too many privacy concerns.  
	My response: Correct, which is why we need a better one. The fact that some people misuse a thing doesn't mean it should be completely abandoned. Are we going to go back to trading sheep because criminals use money laundering practices?

  
	3) At 1:34:00 he finally gets to the point about actual NFTs as a valuable commodity. His reply: we don't know that's going to happen and the market makers could be bad.  
  
So that whole spiel could pretty much be summed up as: crypto uses NFT and most crypto is a scam, therefore NFTs are bad. The good uses of NFTs haven't happened yet, therefore NFTs are bad.  
(This did not require 2 hrs of rambling.)  
  
The expansion into the western frontier was chaotic, full of criminals and little real law, but because that happened does that mean that human expansion is inherently bad? Should the U.S. put a cap on how many children people should have, stop building, and claim that all future expansion will only create the same problems as the Wild West? His counterfactuals have no merit, because he is basing all of it on the worst case scenario, instead of actually thinking that someone could do something good with it.  
  
Sorry for the long reply, but you're the one that sent me a 2 hr video that could have been summed up in 15 mins. ;)",371,huv8sax,t1_hut480p,/r/news/comments/sfqa8k/majority_of_nfts_made_with_free_tool_are/huv8sax/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Keko90,"Not really a NFT person, as in running around Twitter with my monkey profile pic, but I know the whole space pretty well.

Sure someone can do that. But the idea is that the NFT is a certificate of ownership of that original, or more generally thing the NFT is supposed to represent, and in a way that can easily be verified through its public transaction history on the blockchain. You can always tell that a given NFT is the original. It‚Äôs kind of like how the original of the Mona Lisa is priceless when you could just print a JPEG of it and hang it up - that‚Äôs not going to impress anyone despite being visually not really different, since it‚Äôs not THE Mona Lisa.

Take one of the countless memes sold last year as an example. The perceived value comes from the original artist or person on the meme selling it and basically acknowledging ‚Äûyep, I approved this‚Äú, not the image itself. You now have the bragging rights to claim you own THE Nyan Cat.

Now, is it warranted to pay this much for some certificate you own the original of some meme? I mean, there‚Äôs not much of a difference to say buying a baseball signed by Babe Ruth for millions besides one thing being digital if you think about it, and people still do buy and value such things. I‚Äôm honestly surprised there hasn‚Äôt been many (any?) high profile cases yet of someone just trying to go ‚ÄûI‚Äôm selling my meme again!‚Äú a few months after the initial sale, though. Right now there‚Äôs zero legal framework around this type of ownership and a lot of make belief and speculation, so it would be interesting, and honestly necessary, to see how this plays out in a somewhat high profile case.

Things like owning the original of a monkey JPEG comes purely down to speculating on a brand in a few cases and basically gambling in the vast majority of cases.",329,huuutfq,t1_husbx54,/r/news/comments/sfqa8k/majority_of_nfts_made_with_free_tool_are/huuutfq/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

I understand it's the token, not the image/file itself, that's non-fungible. I also understand that the token will generally be an address pointing to the image, ideally with some associated hash of the image itself for verification.

Isn't it possible to host the same image at multiple addresses, or is the image hash itself effectively making it still non-duplicable within a blockchain?

Reddit_Comments,hcschild,"&gt; Arguably any fault of crypto, with respect to bad actors, money has the same, minus any form of tracing at all. So any points of it being ‚Äúbetter‚Äù at ‚Äúbad things‚Äù is not a valid argument.
&gt; 

That's correct everything bad you can do you can do with money or crypto.

&gt; ‚ÄúAccording to the UN, it is estimated that between 2% and 5% of global GDP ($1.6 to $4 trillion) annually is connected with money laundering and illicit activity. This means that criminal activity using cryptocurrency transactions is much smaller than fiat currency and its use is going down year by year.‚Äù

You can't replace the illegal crypto once it got tainted. That most illegal stuff happens with real money makes sense because crypto is used at the moment mostly on darknet market places that only make a tiny fraction of all illegal activities. You still have the problem auf tainting the money from it or when it gets stolen.

&gt;You think it costs more money and energy to use Bitcoin vs. the current financial industry complex? Not even close.

Sorry but that's one of the most shitty articles I've ever seen... Bitcoin had about 400,000 daily transactions in January last year. The Credit Card Visa Network alone has about 150,000,000 daily transactions... So Bitcoin uses about half the energy of the banking system with not even close to 1% of the transactions... And that doesn't include other banking transactions and credit cards. 

&gt;Understanding that not all are fans of PoW‚Ä¶there are other energy friendlier methods.

It would work if we had unlimited energy and resources but we don't. :\\

&gt;As for payments, the rails that run Visa and Mastercard, globally, can accommodate 70,000 transactions per second, they may be able to increase that to 100,000. Bitcoin can only do 7, but Lightning Network increase that to 1,000,000. Again, if you‚Äôre not a BTC fan, there are other very impressive technologies in the space as well.

Ok maybe I should have read this before I've answered the above part but my point still stands. :) The Lightning Network brings  other problems with it like fraud and traceability issues. 

Yes there are a lot of interesting ideas but at the moment many of them are only used to speculate on them or scam people. Most are holding crypto to use it as an investment and not because they want to use it as a currency.

Reddit_Comments,hcschild,"&gt;The only other way is through an ATM, which has its limits.

Not really you can find someone who will get you cash, gold or something else of value. When you get to amounts where this isn't feasible anymore you will have to do the same like any other illegal operation and do money laundering. 

&gt;You‚Äôre forgetting that there is a blockchain record of your transactions, even the ones where Bitcoin seemingly mysteriously appears in your account. If audited, you‚Äôd have to answer for that.

And? It's not like illegal money gets laundered all the time. Set up a business that accepts bitcoin and let it do legitimate sales like maybe... Sell your own NFTs! So many people are paying stupid money at the moment for them so why shouldn't you be able to launder your illegally earnt money with some NFTs. Buy them from a handful of different sources (including your own NFTs). Now your NFT wallet has some crypto without any proof that you are the person who bought them. Yes you will loose money doing it this way but that always the case when you do money laundering.

You can't ban every bitcoin that was used for something illegal because that would make over time a huge portion of it unusable, also it would make the whole decentralised feature a joke. 

&gt; How is this ‚Äúworse‚Äù than money again?

When it's the currency of a stable country? Nearly everything. It costs more money and energy to use bitcoin and just looking at the course of bitcoin from last year to now only shows that it's a completely invalid currency to do business with. It's acting like an unregulated stock and not like a stable currency. 

But it can be a better option for a country with a failed system and giant inflation, but even then it would be better for the people living there to just have Dollars or Euros.",319,hudgm2o,t1_hub01sx,/r/news/comments/scq4vy/drop_bitcoin_as_legal_tender_imf_urges_el_salvador/hudgm2o/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Harabeck,"&gt; NFTs will be used as currency by companies in the same way they issue store credit.

Why would they be NFTs though? They're not meant to be currency. Wouldn't they offer fungible tokens on a store specific chain or something?

&gt;  It also takes fiat out of that equation and would make the crypto it‚Äôs based on the medium of exchange.

And that improves *nothing*. The block chain is so horrible at managing transactions that you have to take transactions off the blockchain to get them done in a reasonable time, which opens you up to all sorts of scams.

&gt; And here‚Äôs a nice write up on how NFTs can change ticket sales. Ticket Sales

The only thing that article talks about that is specific to NFTs is being able to resale the ticket after the event (and also making the ticket verification more complicated lol). Even their claim that digital tickets aren't unique isn't necessarily true. They could grant unique serial numbers on current digital tickets. Also, organizers can grant perks to ticket holders *right now*, digital or not. And I love how it claims that it will stop bots from buying the legit tickets, but there's nothing to actually stop that. And if people buy tickets from fake websites, how does that change with NFT's? There are already entire fake exchanges (look up the [pig butchering scam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUeTegOTmSU)).",227,huajtm9,t1_huaidf0,/r/news/comments/scq4vy/drop_bitcoin_as_legal_tender_imf_urges_el_salvador/huajtm9/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

Reddit_Comments,FireWireBestWire,"So, I would love to understand it. Land ownership in Canada is subject to the rights of ""the Crown,"" so even individuals that own land are subject to the rights of the Crown to take it to use it, and for the government to pass laws regarding its use.  

We have a Land Titles Office, and we use the Torrens System. When properties change hands, the government guarantees the accuracy of the title to that land. Curtain Principle, Mirror Principle, Insurance Principle. This was all worked out 100+ years ago here.  

What value does an NFT add to the existing system?  

When you talk about fundamentals, guns control land. The government controls the guns. If someone with guns tried to take ownership illegally in Canada, government agents would come in with guns and ""evict"" them. The Land Titles Office is useless without the backing of the provincial and ultimately federal government. So the decentralized aspect of many blockchain technologies is useless without the backing of the people with guns.  

The only way legal ownership of anything is useful is when there is an authority to appeal to when that thing is taken. It seems like the blockchain advocates pretend that people will just accept what the 1s and 0s say regarding ownership. And with digital pictures, it doesn't matter. It's all ultimately worthless. The only way any currency has value is the willingness of people to exchange it for food, rent, gas: physical things.

How much is Bitcoin worth? Probably the same as Shiba Inu coin. But one is trading at 36k and the other is at 0.000021. Why? Nobody knows and nobody can explain it. There is no certainty in crypto.

Reddit_Comments,rediKELous,"At this point, nothing would stop you from doing that. Once. You paid to get the real NFT, so you paid for a Rolex. That's a given here based on the situation you laid out. You also paid to buy or create a knock off. You can sell that fake to someone who's willing to pay a good fee for it, but they'll want the NFT because they know a real Rolex comes with a goddamn nft now. Now you've broken even or made a small profit from the caper, great. You can't repeat it. You can't sell it to someone who's willing to pay for it again. You'd just be retailing fakes that are known fakes. And sure, you now have a real Rolex you can wear. But nobody would believe you because you didn't have the NFT and if you tried to prove it on the blockchain, you'd be found to be running a scam and the watch would be sent to the rightful blockchain owner.

That seems like a hell of a lot of work and risk for what *might* net you a small gain. And I'm not even talking about legal risk, I'm saying the risk for you to actually lose money in this endeavor would be high.

That's what I tried to explain to a guy who predicted that NFTs will be everywhere: circa 2000, we had CDs in stores and Napster on the web. Well, we quickly found out people are ok downloading a lower quality sound for free. The response from the music industry was to sue people who downloaded and shared songs on Napster , eventually it became unsustainable and it had to adapt by selling single songs online and create an entire infrastructure that eventually turned into the MAAS (Music as a service) model we're familiar with: Spotify, Pandora, etc...

People are building them ""because they can"" but they're not particularly functional and leave a lot of people saying ""why?""

With that being said, NFTs can represent digital rights and ownership that, because they're connected with a deposit address, can be paid out on the fly.

Artists could literally stake or sell the backend or rights through NFT minting. Not only that, but licensing deals and copyright usage doesn't have to grind to a halt for a licensing dispute or sale to be resolved. Both can happen independently.

This is one example of a use case and a lot of cool things can happen with NFT representation pointing back to a payment address.

Even if you owned NFTs for all your Steam games, they can still shut the games down.  ""Can't be taken away"" -- but we still don't have to let you play it.  YOu own the NFT for your license of Halo, but Microsoft doesn't have to let you log in.

I love the bullshit story about how you can buy a helmet and it can never be taken away from you -- but it's still going to be utterly worthless when that game shuts down or no one is playing it any more.

I won't say that there is no use case for a digital certificate that can't be faked or stolen.  But other than ""digital certificate that can't be faked or stolen"", there is no ""there"" there.

Jahhhst stahhhhp trying to make it sound like it fixes any of the problems currently plaguing the online world.

It's not about the stupid pictures of stupid monkeys that makes the concept mostly a solution in search of a problem.

I can see it being a component of self-executing contracts -- but there is a huge paradigm shift that would be required in the world's legal systems before self-executing contracts become more than a novelty or a very narrow niche use case.  It's intrinsic to the nature of a contract that the validity of the contract itself can be called into question.  The law has to have a mechanism by which a contract ***can be stopped*** before it executes -- and in some cases can be rescinded even after the contract is no longer executory.  

This is not a question of making contract law ready for self-execution.  It's fixing self-execution so that it's ready to become a creature of law.  Human beings make mistakes, act maliciously and act against their own self-interest when pushed to extremes -- and contracts law reflects this and has centuries of built-in safeguards.  The blockchain is sexy and shiny, but a thousand years of institutional wisdom isn't going to just be swept away because a bunch of narrow-minded linear-thinking nerds think it fixes anything.

All of contract law in the civil- and common-law worlds is based on the idea that conditions have to meet human review before they can be considered final.",382,hu4ljny,t1_hu3239b,/r/news/comments/sbm8dx/bitcoin_value_tumbles_almost_50_since_record/hu4ljny/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

Reddit_Comments,MeetComplete,"In their current incarnation an NFT would be more like getting ownership of a parking space and whatever car is contained within it. When you bought it there was a car you wanted there and you expect that car to be there in future, that's why you bought it, but you don't actually have full control over or a guarantee of that being the case - the car could be removed or replaced at some point in future with nothing you can do about it. You'd still have your certificate for the parking space but tough shit that the car supplier decided to get rid of yours. 

And that I think shows one of the problems with them. The technology can and probably will be improved in time but it's definitely not there yet and honestly I'm not really convinced it's something we need at all or will ever really be a good idea long term. Digital things tend to be replaced pretty quickly especially if you think of the timescales you might want to hold ownership of an investment for. If I made some expensive investment I'd want no risk that the server, URL, block chain or whatever part might just go away or be changed one day and those are very real risks. I mean does anyone believe that the current tech being used for these things will be the same as many years from now? If not then your non-fungible token probably comes with an unknown expiry date for whenever that tech becomes obsolete or that hosting company goes down or that content creator purges their ancient content or whatever.

And all the above is ignoring the very real possibility that at some unknown point in the future this crypto and related bubbles could go the way of the Tulip bulbs.",303,hu34ep7,t1_hu27pkn,/r/news/comments/sbm8dx/bitcoin_value_tumbles_almost_50_since_record/hu34ep7/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

The main thrust of the video is a breakdown of the history of cryptocurrency, tracing its *sociological* roots back to the market crash of 2008, forwards to the invention of the technology itself, and then through the years up until the current NFT craze. He goes into detail not only about what the technology does, but what it *doesn't* do, and what its evangelists have *claimed* it will do that it actually cannot and should not be used for. He also analyzes the culture that has sprung up around cryptocurrency in general and NFTs in specific, the kinds of people pushing them, and the kinds of people who fall for the scam. It's not just a video on ""here's what an NFT is"", it's an exhaustively thorough and well-researched breakdown of the technology, its history, the culture surrounding it, the major players behind it, and what we can expect to see from it in the future.

Any value of the concept of say Blockchain isn't really what anyone is buying when they're minting or buying coins or NFTs. Even then there really isn't anything crypto is replacing or seen as needed to make the internet happen.

Your argument gets really abstract to go into ""what is value? Or purpose? Or things? Or meaning?"". Sure, if humans didn't exist there wouldn't be the concept of value but that's just trying to drag everything down into metaphysical uncertainty to justify things like taking out a second mortgage to buy more NFTs.

Reddit_Comments,Mr_Blinky,"&gt;You think we'll be using nation state based cash in 20 years?

...yes? Absolutely. Duh. You think the major world governments are going to allow a *decentralized currency* to take away their leverage over markets, their control over inflation and deflation? No way in hell. The only reason crypto exists in the form it *currently* does is because up to this point there's been nothing to really spend it on aside from drugs on shady-ass websites, and governments haven't really bothered to crack down on it before now. The entire reason NFTs exist is basically because some cryptobros realized there was nothing to actually spend cryptocurrency on to convince people to buy into more crypto, so they came up with a scam where you get to ""own"" something ""real"" with it to give it an air of legitimacy. The second crypto starts becoming a major economic player outside of speculative markets and actually starts impacting the real world I can guarantee it's going to get fucking *smashed* by regulation.

Crypto is likely here to stay, but crypto as it currently exists on the chain is never going to be anything more than a gimmick, unless the tech bros behind it somehow manage to convince a bunch of other hypercapitalist techbros that they can all make a shitload of money off exploiting the market. And even if that happens, they have to hope giant markets like China don't just chop it right off.",240,hu1ir24,t1_hu1ghdb,/r/news/comments/sbm8dx/bitcoin_value_tumbles_almost_50_since_record/hu1ir24/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

Same with peloton, or most tech stocks that if you sold all their assets, and took all their revenue in a year they are still at a fraction of what their market cap is. Then tech companies show off things like Watson, and Tesla‚Äôs Vega traffic jam, and despite them never working or seeing the light of day the stock goes up literal smoke and mirrors. 

&gt;if it were to become mainstream it would be absolutely ecologically devastating because that‚Äôs how mining will intrinsically due to its decentralized unregulated nature, even if we get more efficient cheaper ways for getting power miners won‚Äôt become more ethical they‚Äôll just make a bigger rig

A lot of them are moving away from mining, still if we are really worried about energy and greenhouse gas, then we should switch what we use. Someone who leaves their computer running for a Minecraft farm all night then game all day is doing as much harm as your average bitcoin miner.

Reddit_Comments,TavisNamara,"There's a huge list of reasons why this isn't going to work out, and my initial response to you vanished spontaneously for some reason (I clicked off to do something else and when I looked back my reply had simply vanished, 90% complete...), so I'm gonna just give you the short version from some copy-pastes of why both NFTs and crypto in general are a massive scam that, if it ever catches on, will only fuck us over more.

1:

Creating artificial scarcity as a design goal, which is very counter to the idea of a free and open web of information. This makes the privatization of the web easier. Using that artificial scarcity to drive a speculation market then hurts most people except hedge funds, grifters, and the extremely lucky.

2: 

NFTs are not rights. They never have been, and never will be. They are *a receipt*. In order for that receipt to have literally any value, that receipt has to be acknowledged as legitimate. There are exactly two groups who currently think those receipts are legitimate: Scammers and crypto bros. And the scammers are very, very selective in which ones they consider legitimate. Specifically: Theirs.

3:

&gt;The most damning dealbreaker (to me) for cryptocurrencies is that the biggest adopters of cryptocurrencies currently are banks, hedge funds, and daytraders. The people who got in on the ground floor of cryptocurrencies are the mega-rich capitalists. The people profiting most from the so-called democratization / decentralization of finance are centralized banks, rich fucks, scammers, launderers. Those are the people who are benefiting most, and do you think that's gonna change if cryptocurrencies become world standard? I do not. Rather, I think if cryptocurrencies were to become world standard, those rich fucks would've long-since secured themselves as kings. Just kings of a different currency. I would argue they already control cryptocurrency, even if some lucky DOGE buyers got rich on a fluke. Also, this time everyone's names are hidden from the transaction records, whoops! Good luck legislating that away when the big lobbyists all have a vested interest in keeping their lobbying hidden from the eyes of the public!

It is a simple fact that everything that can currently be done with crypto and NFTs can be done better by using pre-existing methods, with the singular potential exception of scamming people. It will never be what you want it to be.",393,hswmjsp,t1_hswdwd0,/r/news/comments/s58fp0/panic_as_kosovo_pulls_the_plug_on_its/hswmjsp/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,public,0

Instead of buying a copy of a song or movie on itunes like you did 10 years ago, an artist could mint up and sell a million NFTs for a new song, and fans could literally purchase and own that song, while an artist can also avoid a bunch of third party, profiteering middleman bullshit.

Yea... exactly my point.

&gt; Why new users? Managers, breeders, whales aka the ""older investors"" are the ones that tend to buy the tokens because they use it to breed.

Because that is also not about Axie but about traditional ponzies? 

&gt; Are you saying the game purposely made it hard for people to cash out so people store more wealth in game?

Yes. For the first layer. If you had to hold 1 eth in a game wallet in order to play, thats just a withdrawl from their wallet. If you pay 1 eth for one of their axies. You only have an axie you need to sell to someone else. They don't owe you anything. Thats why traditional ponzi games are dying out and everyone is moving to crypto. Hell, even pretty much every traditional ponzi game is saying they earn their revenue from crypto. (They don't earn shit, thats a lie. To create the fictional source of the funds that they supposedly use to pay you. In case you don't know enough about ponzis)

&gt; Define ""hard"" because it's not hard at all to liquidate your assets in this game except for breeders/managers who actually hold the axies becuase they do need to sell them. Even then, axies sell out fast.

Exactly as you said. They still sell because the supposed earning potential is supposedly high and enough people still trust it to keep operating long enough for them to earn their money back. (This also generates a big army of supporters that will tell you the game is awesome, because they want it to keep going until they earned their money back, even if they lost faith)

Scholars aren't in the ponzi system. As long as they don't have to pay to become a scholar. They are required to keep the pretens of a game alive, as otherwise those who are investing and hording all the nfts couldn't use them all to ""earn"".

&gt; What trust? can you elaborate?

Trust.... you trust it to be real... if not you cash out. But if the general consensus is that its not real, no one will buy your stuff.

However, by making it possible to sell your in game stuff, buying items can be framed as an ""investment"". Where in a gacha game, the money just goes straight down the drain, Axie players can sell off all their NFTs on the market and get money back. But since the total amount of NFTs in the system is constantly increased by players grinding the game, the nominal value of all players' wallets grows at a greater rate than the actual money flowing in.

Reddit_Comments,-Swade-,"I think one of the hard things is that for an outsider, identifying a bubble doesn‚Äôt suddenly make it pop. You can look at lots of isolated bubbles (regional housing, NFTs, crypto, etc) and people have been openly calling whatever it  is a bubble for decades. And they‚Äôre right.

The problem is that doesn‚Äôt help an individual act. And someone who for example said in 2013, ‚ÄúSeattle housing prices are just a bubble!‚Äù may be correct but the bubble hasn‚Äôt burst 9 years later.

Are we due for a market crash? Yeah, absolutely. But what if you had thought that last year and pulled out your investments, you‚Äôd have missed the 2021 rally and (as of today) been poorer.

More to the point, what if, bubble or not, you want to buy a house. But you‚Äôve been waiting for the past decade because *obviously* the market is inflated.

This doesn't make sense since Twitter since it's inception has been a complete money loser. Twitter as a company has been trying to monetize it and everything they do (read: Don't give a fucking edit button that many people want) pisses their base off.

""Let's give people NFT profile pictures, surely that'll monetize the site!""

\[Everyone but CryptoBros disliked that\].jpg

""Let's joke about giving an edit button!""

\[Everyone still begs us for it anyway\].jpg

""Let's do 'Twitter blue!' For $10 a month you can edit your tweets ~~within the next 30 seconds!~~""

\[Everyone doesn't subscribe to that\].jpg

Jack was only let go because 1) everything he did was absolute shit. 2) ANYTHING he did do was after going on a long sabbatical while Trump/et. al. shitpost with a nuke suitcase on-hand and 3) anything else he tried to implement failed.

So he can fuck off with that whole ""oh I'm sorry for centralizing the internet"" when he went to be a cryptobro AND his former company still won't implement shit people want.

Reddit_Comments,LigerXT5,"Hey Samsung,

Can I get a TV that is just a TV, please?

I have other devices that I can interchange (consoles, chrome cast, etc.), does everything the smart side of a Smart TV does, and easily stay up to date. I just need a display that will function, and not potentially brick itself little by little, all because a couple apps are no longer updated, or hasn't been able to check for an update for X period. Thanks!

I've got a couple smart TVs, granted no Samsung, both of which lasted maybe three years before apps like Netflix or Hulu stopped working, all because the apps can't update anymore.

A client of my IT Shop bought a Smart TV, older lady who was retired, and couldn't use the TV until it had reached out to the internet for an update. Funny thing, she didn't have internet, had no need. The local Walmart didn't have any non-smart TVs. To my knowledge, this is the only smart TV I've touched that required the internet. Thankfully, after the update through a hotspot (my cell), was able to disable the update function (otherwise nagged every half hour due to no internet), and she was able to watch satellite and DVDs normally. I can only suspect a factory reset, accidental or otherwise, will require internet again during setup.

I'm not necessarily that old, early 30s, I can see *some* use cases for NFTs, but most I see talked about, are just flashy and stupid. Maybe NFTs for owning digital movies might be a thing, making it easy like physical to give/sell your owned copy to someone else, unlike other services like Amazon where you buy a movie, or Steam where you buy a game, and it's on your account, with no way to give it to someone else. I don't know about Amazon, but in Steam/Valve, if you pass away, you can't just give your account and all its contents to someone, family or not.",326,i32plrq,t3_ttx8sp,/r/technology/comments/ttx8sp/samsung_details_how_its_tvs_will_become_nft/i32plrq/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0

Reddit_Comments,DJ906,"In this case, the price going lower will allow many others to join in and subsequently drive the price up. This will help boost revenue and volume of shareholders. For GME, this is a good thing that is factored into the plan. RC also knows apes love a good fire sale and will buy a ton of stock--making it undoubtedly obvious the naked short sellers and the amount GME has been abused. It will not be able to be ignored. 

All this then puts in place the reward for shareholders, heavy gains on their now split stocks, and GME can move forward with the plans for 'financial compensation' mentioned in their last earnings report. They also mentioned NFTs, digital market places, and so on. There is a plan and it is set to deploy. 

Not to forget RC also wants apes to research the companies and people tied to these nefarious acts and the web of crime associated with them. It is far reaching and throughout our financial and business industries as well as charities and everywhere. People do a lot of bad crime under the guise of dark pools and donating to charities and running them. If you ever need a rabbit hole to go down, check out the saga of GME. This isn't the first 'naked short selling into oblivion', but it will hopefully be the last. There have been many companies that would've done such good things if not prayed upon by predatory short sellers and advisory companies. There is more to the whole GME story than what meets the eye. Do your own research and be wary of what the mainstream media says. Hint...they are not on your side...and haven't been for a while.


It's a gamble I'm not willing to wait and see what happens. You can make your own decision. When you do, buy, hold, &amp; DRS through Computershare.

Then they have to know who holds the shares to give the dividend. There‚Äôs 100,000,000 shares now and they are asking for 1,000,000,000 instead.

Reddit_Comments,SgtDoughnut,"It's mainly a problem with ledgers where you can put things in someone wallet without their confirmation.  Eth is an example.

Real world scenario that came up when nfts hit, people would craft fake nfts that would automatically transfer everything in a person's wallet to a different account if you interacted well th it at all.  It would just show up in your account one day.  If you even just clicked on it to find out what it was the payload would go off and it will upd steal all your stuff.

And to the eth ledger this is 100% legit and eth will do nothing to prevent that.  Not even a ""are you sure"" dialogue box popping up.

It's literally click gone done.  

You are talking potentially immense sums of money.  Some people have more crypto than a small country has a budget and yet zero safeguards are in place incase the user is compromised.

And hackers and cyber criminals almost never attempt man in the middle, which crypto is incredibly strong against.  It's always an attack on where the data is first entered.  Thanks to the ability for me to just drop things into your wallet, things that can make transactions on your behalf without your approval the ledger is susceptible to false info.  Because it trusts itself and it's users far too much.

Some have tried to solve this problem but they either aren't important enough cause they aren't worth anything.  Or are too slow to really be used.

Add onto that the entire ecosystem that has evolved to facilitate converting one crypto into another and it's a huge problem.  Because sn exploit or false data set propagating on one ledger can infect others with nobody noticing untill it's far too late.",300,i2idkzh,t1_i2iawvn,/r/technology/comments/tqbm4k/democrats_propose_proprivacy_digital_dollar/i2idkzh/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0

Many of them don't. Quite a few NFT services are only available on Android phones because of these charges. Besides, they don't have a choice if their customer's want it, they probably just pass on the costs in fees.

Reddit_Comments,Aetheus,"&gt;It's garbage because we have something similar?

No, it's garbage because it does not meaningfully (and usefully) distinguish itself from the ""something similar"" that we already have. The Internet, smartphones, etc - they might not have had universal adoption from day 1, but their proponents were clearly touting their value proposition from day 1. 

Nobody (not even the likes of the companies developing their own ""metaverses"") even seems to have an idea of what the ""metaverse"" *is,* or what you're supposed to do in it. All descriptions of it thus far have been vague video-game / VRChat pitches, occasionally mixed with a bit of snake oil (NFTs). Even the promises that you can ""take one thing you bought here and bring it to somewhere else in the Metaverse"" so common in many pitches makes no sense - each ""metaverse"" that an individual company makes is its own walled garden, and they'd have to build in support for external assets from external ""metaverses"".

The utility is simply not well explained - you can't handwave stuff away by saying ""Oh, nobody believed in *the Internet* at first either!"", even Bill in that video gave a good pitch of what the Internet would be *for*. Some ideas, no matter how futuristic, are just plain stupid. Flying cars, for instance.

Reddit_Comments,shadowrun456,"&gt;I remain unconvinced. The examples you listed are all what I would call fringe, if not completely fictional.

My examples are, by definition, fictional, because they don't exist yet. Fringe? Sure, but this was said about every new technology. People about mobile phones in 1999: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bdWZocq4vQ (click subtitles for English). You may not remember, but that was the mainstream opinion and ""common sense"" at the time. Just like with NFTs now.

I don't really have a goal to ""convince"" you as such. I am just expressing my opinion, based on my personal, academic, and professional experience (Bachelor's degree in programming, Master's degree in crypto, part-time working as a lecturer).

&gt;The number of people who want to transfer their ingame items to another game after the original already failed is minuscule

&gt;Same thing with digital media, the amount of people who genuinely only want to resell their old collections is negligible.

I agree, but see my first paragraph and video about people's opinion about mobile phones in 1999.

&gt;as is the number of people seriously affected by duping.

I strongly disagree here, I think item duping is one of the major unsolved (until now) problems in online gaming. Rockstar made over 1 billion $ just from selling in-game GTA cash in GTA Online for real $. And this is despite the fact, that almost every time I got online there was some hacker dropping unlimited amounts of GTA cash for anyone who wanted just for lulz. Now imagine it was impossible to duplicate GTA cash. Of course, most of those hackers won't start buying it for real $, but if making GTA cash unduplicatable increases Rockstar's sales of it even by 10%, that's already additional 100 million $ for Rockstar.

&gt;We also already had ingame auction houses and the like which achieved most, if not all, of what you stated without the need for NFTs.

The main difference is that previously this was achieved using a centralized database run and controlled by the company who created it. No company is ever going to use a db created and controlled by another company for their own game, as it would make their success completely dependent on the whims of the company which controls the db. NFTs solve that by introducing a decentralized, public, neutral tech standard, which anyone can use, but no single company can control.",385,i16nenp,t1_i107ocx,/r/technology/comments/teepat/i_need_to_use_my_cds_again_social_media/i16nenp/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Moonlapsed,"Simply look at from where the NFT was issued. If an NFT was issued/minted by the UKR gov't, you need only verify that. Meaning make sure you are watching the official one. It simply cannot be faked, unless the UKR govt deepfaked themselves. No experts/witchhunts required, and anyone can verify authenticity. Easy verification by anyone is the main argument here. 

I don't disagree that it was found to be fake quickly. This will not always be the case, and they will become increasingly difficult to discern to the average normie. The solution for this is available. We need to stop being jaded on NFT's.

Reddit_Comments,Aggropop,"I remain unconvinced. The examples you listed are all what I would call fringe, if not completely fictional.

The number of people who want to transfer their ingame items to another game after the original already failed is minuscule as is the number of people seriously affected by duping. Why a gaming company would allow people to bring in items from outside their environment, potentially cutting into their own RMT is also unaddressed. We also already had ingame auction houses and the like which achieved most, if not all, of what you stated without the need for NFTs. I also think these had a universally detrimental effect for the games themselves, as NFTs inevitably will too, but that's another topic. Same thing with digital media, the amount of people who genuinely only want to resell their old collections is negligible.

This isn't a case of me not seeing the potential for artificially scarce digital goods, it's a case of all the proposed use cases being based on bad assumptions, overly optimistic and intentionally misleading.

Reddit_Comments,shadowrun456,"You're looking at the first generation of NFTs and fail to see the benefits this technology will bring when it's fully developed and widely used. This is normal, it was very difficult to understand the benefits of email when sending an email included using your landline phone to dial into your modem, flipping some mechanical switches, and then using DOS commands to send the actual email. Also, almost no one used email or even knew what it was, so there was no one you could really write an email to.

Here's an instructional video from 1984 showing ""how easy it is to send an email"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdbKz5CyhA

Most people after watching it at that time went ""yep, this is dumb, no one will ever use this"".

Now, when you can send email with one click on your smartphone to probably any person you know, the benefits are obvious. They weren't in 1984.

It's demonstrably useful being able to create items in a video game which are impossible to duplicate (every single online game I know of until now had duplication glitches), don't disappear even if the company who made the game goes bankrupt and shuts down the servers, and can be easily implemented into any other game.

It's demonstrably useful being able to easily transfer your purchased song/movie/game/book/etc to anyone else, even to people who use different services than you.

And that's just two potential use cases. Yes, this doesn't exist yet, but the technology which enables this exists, and it didn't before.

It takes time and lots of steps to reach a situation where a critical mass of companies join this, and until only a few companies do, I agree that the benefits will be minuscule compared to what they will be when everyone joins. But you can't get to that point without making the first steps, which will inevitably include lots of failed projects, scams, money-grabs, etc. - just like every new technology did.",318,i0yrunr,t1_i0rrr6z,/r/technology/comments/teepat/i_need_to_use_my_cds_again_social_media/i0yrunr/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Sloloem,"I think we're still a bit shy on the actual implementation details so I had to give provisional answers for a few things but the grey areas are all surrounding how Snoop's new Death Row Records will provide access to music once they transition to being an ""NFT Label"".  The NFTs themselves, what they are, how they're made/sold/destroyed aren't in a grey area so those answers are concrete.

""Ownership"" is often touted as a selling point of NFTs and crypto but all you own is the ""token"".  Without scarcity nothing can be owned, and digital goods cannot be scarce.  You pay hundreds of dollars to assign a hash and a URL to your crypto wallet.

If they're going to run a streaming service based on NFTs all they're doing is checking to see if your wallet is assigned a specific NFT and only letting you stream the song if you have it.  Realistically in that use case it's not significantly different than a traditional license file or just assigning a license to your account.  Except if they'd used a public blockchain like Ethereum then it costs hundreds of dollars to create, transaction fees to sell to other people, and are _WAY_ more wasteful of computing resources and electricity than traditional licensing which is often a contributing factor to the tendency of pitchfork-wielding mobs to follow NFT announcements around.",231,i0sug1o,t1_i0sjfph,/r/technology/comments/teepat/i_need_to_use_my_cds_again_social_media/i0sug1o/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Sloloem,"No one should _ever_ want an NFT to replace the title or deed to things they actually own.  I want crypto as far away from anything I rely on for comfort or livelihood as possible.  Proponents like to tout aspects of the decentralized nature of public blockchains and the ""If you can do it, you can do it"" approach as good things but for your actual property that's the last thing you actually want.  And this is why:  Blockchains are immutable.  It's their fundamental design feature.  It's what the technology _does_.  Meaning any transaction on a blockchain is permanent.  Even fraudulent ones.  Even coerced ones.  Even ones with errors.

This ""wild west"" attitude is an asset if you're looking to run an unregulated speculative market, not so much if you want to be able to protect your property.  If someone breaks into your wallet they can take all your NFTs, immediately and irrevocably.  The folks hyping crypto will say you should have protected your wallet better because if you have the wallet you can do anything you want with it.  As far as the blockchain is concerned, accessing the wallet is enough to prove you own everything in it.  When these NFTs point at stupid fucking clipart, we get make fun of that loss.  But if the NFT is what says you own your car or your own house you're fucked.  The _best case_ scenario is that the person that stole my NFT can sell it back to me if I cover gas fees.  But since according to the blockchain everything that's happened is fair and square, I have no other recourse than to hope they don't feel like extorting me and are willing to deal.

If someone breaks into my house and steals the title to my car they can't register the title change without me signing off.  Sure they can forge my signature or something but as soon as I'm able to appeal to a higher power at the DMV and prove it was faked, the DMV can just fix the data.  I'm not gonna say the DMV can't be rigged or always works right and never screws people who are in the right but at least there's an option.  There's someone to appeal to and if everything is working right the system can fix fraud or errors.  With NFTs there's no such thing because they're decentralized and that's considered a selling point.  There's no authority to deny any valid transaction or to seize your assets held on the chain like there is with traditional banking, but the opposite side of the same coin is that there's no authority to oversee the legitimacy of anything so if you accidentally fat-fingered the transaction and sold your car for $5...sucks to be you.",483,i0sqcmp,t1_i0pnkmw,/r/technology/comments/teepat/i_need_to_use_my_cds_again_social_media/i0sqcmp/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0

Reddit_Comments,FalseFortune,"The individual NFTs are unique but the asset tied to them does not have to be. 

Creating a NFT is referred to as minting or tokenizing, you can mint as many ""copies"" of the ""asset"" as you want. Many artist will mint thousands of NFTs of the same piece of art. But typically the less total minted of an item the more valuable the NFT would be. Also the first minted typically holds more value that the preceding mints. The NTF itself is more like a certificate of authenticity or a title of ownership. 

Ford sells thousands of red F150s each one can be identical in appearance to the other but the vin number and the title make each one unique, that in a sense is what a NFT is. Actually if Ford chose to, and could get state DMVs to adopt it, they could replace there vehicle titles with NFTs. This is where the average person could find real value in NFTs. They can be used for tamper proof, non forge-able, non replicable titles of ownership for any real property, land, house, car, ect...

ROUGH hypothetical:

Mint a song NFT file with unlimited capacity.

Set it so it can only be minted from a specific contract address and have a royalty applied to secondary sales of said NFT file.

In theory someone could say 

‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt care if I can listen to this song file anymore. I can use YouTube and I don‚Äôt need it when I don‚Äôt have internet‚Äù

And then offer to sell their song NFT to someone else for less than the cost to mint an original.

The artist/label could ensure they get something from the resale with the royalty encoded and the user now has a secondary market for something digital.

Crude example, but feasible.

Reddit_Comments,g_squidman,"This such a truly bizarre comment. Unhinged really. The hate for NFTs breaches every logical barrier.

NFTs are designed to raise money for public goods. Vanced created a public good that a LOT of people clearly found very valuable. The problem is that this public good was stealing money from a greedy corporation. That's illegal.

So it needs funding, but it can't charge money directly. It needs to stay free. The solution is almost certainly going to involve crypto. NFTs are a perfect form of retroactive public goods funding.

It was a solution where everyone wins, especially users who don't want to pay for stuff - especially stuff that shouldn't be paywalled in the first place, like background play.

Face it. This was the perfect example of NFTs being a force for good - unambiguously and without any downsides.",135,i0lihdo,t1_i0l5np4,/r/technology/comments/tdjf8i/youtube_vanced_is_shutting_down_due_to_legal/i0lihdo/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0

I literally can't even think of one... but for the sake of argument say... virtual concerts where you're on stage with the band rocking out.

No, this is just stupid garbage I don't want or need stacked on top of stupid garbage I don't want or need.

Reddit_Comments,yumtastical,"I agree with your point, mostly.  If you're not in VR, most people aren't going to put on a headset just to order wings.  Like I said, it's about convenience.  If you already have a headset on, you'll be able to order wings without taking them off.  That's one thing companies are looking to do.  The other potential scenario is that exact scenario you describe.  From the customer's perspective, ""why would I put on a VR headset just to order wings?"".  Maybe companies decide it's not lucrative enough to try to incentivize customers to put on a headset to order wings.  Maybe though they can do it via coupons/discounts such as discounts on your order or future order, or even giving you a credit (or virtual currency credit) that can be applied to buying other virtual goods in the future.

Considering where we are with NFTs and crypto (I'm not making any socioeconomic comment on either), it's not outside the realm of possibility that all of these companies (and especially banks) may not try to create a virtual currency that is restricted to virtual goods or physical goods ordered virtually.",197,hz78uap,t1_hz76cv8,/r/technology/comments/t5rz6t/wingstop_has_filed_a_trademark_to_sell_chicken/hz78uap/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0

Well, first off, you are more tech literate, and are not a 62 year old widow. You aren't the typical target of a romance scam. There are more common pitfalls for you, like NFTS or whatever. You'll be old and dumb some day, don't worry, but maybe not today.

And secondly, you are missing the whole point. Romance scams already work at a ridiculous rate. This is a wrinkle to the romance scam where they aren't even asking for money. It's something people need to be aware of. If your single mum comes to you and says ""Hey I met a nice guy from Australia"" that should cause red flags. If your mum says ""Oh, I've got a friend whose gotten me into investing recently"" you need to know that you should be asking more questions.

Can't see any musician or label trying to limit revenue from a good that reproduces for $0. 

Same goes for electronics. Cost of development, manufacturing, means if they can sell the same product continuously, there's little motivation to limit it let alone improve it. 

This is him doubling down on the stem player probably because he didn't hit the numbers first time around, leftover stock or he placed a reorder and is banking on this motivate more sales.

Reddit_Comments,slantedangle,"&gt;I try to keep an open mind about these things. Jeff Bezos had trouble getting funding for Amazon because people thought the internet was a fad.

The internet brought functionality which drastically altered the ways, as well as introduced new ways, in which businesses and people could perform tasks substantially better. Metaverse does not. Infact, the propositions are mostly in ways which will make the tasks worse and slower, promising only to make it ""cool"". Actually a ""fad"". Only a few small narrow niche markets would benefit from metaversing and marginally so. Without understanding the mechanical features that make an endeavor worthy of converting to this paradigm, people are rushing to find ways to shoehorn an excuse to do so. In other words, a ""fad"". 

To be fair,  The internet also had a period it went through similar to this in its early days. The difference is that the internet has features that previously did not exist, and only when such features could be exploited did it emerge from a being just a fad. Ubiquitous connectivity, speed, scalability, convenience, platform flexibility. We already have these with internet. Meta does not add anything new. 

&gt;I try and try and try to imagine a scenario where things like the metaverse and NFTs are legitimately great ideas, but I just can‚Äôt get there

They are indeed great ideas. Great ideas are a dime a dozen. You have to demonstrate them to be great implementations. 

&gt;For all these companies to be investing all this money, I feel like they are privy to certain information that we‚Äôre not.

Reddit_Comments,Cybugger,"First off: why would I purchase a picture of a stupid ape when I can literally google the same JPEG right now, and save it to my desktop? See! I have it on my computer now. It's not Fallon's. 

He doesn't own it, otherwise I couldn't do that, or of I did, it would be theft. But I have it. I didn't commit a crime.

This is the difference with the card example from above. To get it, you'd have to steal it from me. But I have the exact same picture as Fallon, pixel for pixel. There is no uniqueness.

Second, I am the owner of my newly saved JPEG. I can do what I want to it. I can keep it as is, transform it, change it, delete it, or send it to someone else.

The two aren't directly comparable in any sense.

Thirdly, you still haven't dealt with the **fact** that there is no way to verify that the individual who mints is the actual creator. All you're doing is hoping that the entry point to the system is the correct one. All of blockchain is based on this fundamental misunderstanding of security. Yes, it's highly effective at stopping Man in the Middle type attacks. But who cares when the primary source of insecurity in a system is the entry point, and crypro and NFTs do nothing ti solve this.

Reddit_Comments,Cybugger,"It's not the case.

If I'm an artist, and can prove I made the art, a court will side with me.

Your NFT is **not** the image. It's the little bit of encapsulated code. That's the unique thing. Not the picture. So you could get a court to side with you for using that same little contract, but not the image, because the image is not the thing that you own. It's the code generated during minting. But not the image.

I can post apes wherever the fuck I want. No one can or will stop me. Because they don't own them.

And no one cares about the copyright associated with an infinitely reproducible copyright. That's the problem. For copyright to apply, you have to actively defend it. In other words, you have to aggressively claim false use. The problem is that because it's solely a digital good, you're flat out of luck. I can reproduce, share and send out reproductions of your work way quicker than anyone can whack-a-mole me down with copyright claims. And therefore, it will have expanded into the public domain, and no longer warrant copyright protection.

There's a public ledger **of who minted it**. Not who made it. Understand the difference? I can start minting stuff that I didn't make, and there's no verification process to verify that the person doing the minting is the creator. This has been a massive problem.

After artists in their droves complained that their songs were being distributed against their wishes, the platform admitted that the tracks were being pulled from YouTube. Even worse, one of those musicians is artists' champion David Lowery, a fighter they really don't want to take on.

&gt; The non-fungible token (NFT) craze that‚Äôs been sweeping the internet for months now is a truly sight to behold. Huge sums of cryptocurrency are traded for these often Ethereum blockchain ‚Äòitems‚Äô alongside dreams that one day they will be worth substantially more.

&gt; As a result, the hype around NFTs (particularly where they relate to some kind of art) has reached astonishing levels, with new projects appearing all the time promising to revolutionize this and democratize that. Since the music industry is often criticized for not doing enough to support artists, some platforms have decided they can do better.

&gt; Thus far, it hasn‚Äôt gone well. Early February the RIAA stepped in to issue a cease-and-desist against HitPiece.com, describing it as a scam site designed to mislead and defraud fans with its offer to sell them NFTs genuinely associated with artists. According to their RIAA, that certainly wasn‚Äôt the case

&gt; With HitPiece now in some kind of hibernation, another NFT-focused platform has been thrust into the spotlight afting launching this month. NFT Music Stream promises a ‚Äúnew chain of sound‚Äù alongside pledges to bring artists, fans, distributors and labels together ‚Äúin one single beautiful, efficient and transparent‚Äù NFT music platform.

&gt; ‚ÄúNFT MUSIC STREAM is a fun, exciting private NFT Music platform where content creators can charge for audio &amp; music content and get paid in crypto. It gives investors the freedom to distribute, monetize, and stream audio via our NFT MUSIC Streaming Platform,‚Äù the service says.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe have established a decentralized music distribution and royalty management system to better reward artists and their fans. NFT Music Stream connects fans directly with artists in a beautiful music player interface.‚Äù

&gt; That music player was available on Streamer.fm but despite its claims to help ‚Äúcut out the middle man‚Äù to give artists a greater share of the spoils, many quickly realized that something was amiss. According to the masses of complaints from artists on Twitter, few ‚Äì if any ‚Äì had agreed to have their music placed on the platform.

&gt; Composer Kerry Muzzey, for example, took to Twitter to complain that the new streaming service had no rights to monetize his copyrighted works. However, after an unspecified number of DMs to the @nftmusicstream account, they blocked him along with many other artists making similar complaints.",452,hxai6ho,t3_sulh16,/r/technology/comments/sulh16/disaster_as_nft_music_stream_enrages_artists_by/hxai6ho/,0,technology,t5_2qh16,,,0

The metaverse is a combination of things that people don't want and things that have already existed for a long time.  VR for example had existed for a long time.  It has recently become a lot more advanced, but people still prefer interacting using a controller and screen as they have for over 30 years.  The VR people haven't even developed a helmet that is comfortable to wear for more than an hour, and these tech moguls are talking about people going to work in VR?  The concept of an online avatar and life is also already a thing - called Second Life.  Their only real innovation is using NFTs to allow porting of digital items from platform to platform or game to game which isn't even something that most people want that much, and the technical and legal problems are surprisingly hairy, maybe even insurmountable.

Reddit_Comments,__Hello_my_name_is__,"&gt;  your transactions can only be reversed if you can somehow convince the majority of the network to do that. If only your NFT gets stolen, it's unlikely that the whole network would agree to reverse that transaction just for you. 

So, in practice: No, this is not at all possible. And so, in practice, the blockchain is absolutely immutable in this specific case. In *theory*, sure, if you can get everyone to agree, it is mutable. But in practice, it absolutely is not.

That was my point.

&gt; This has actually happened and it's why we have Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is the remainder of the nodes who did not agree to revert.

Maybe Wikipedia is wrong on this one, but over there it's stated pretty clearly that Ethereum Classic is the original blockchain, and Ethereum as we know it today is the fork. All other sources I find say the same. That seems to contradict what you said.

&gt; I think you should look into it more in terms of ""which chain has the most supporters"" and not ""which chain is closest to the original"".

Sure, that's fair. But terms like ""fork"" are clearly defined. It is very clear which version is the fork and which version isn't. ETH is the fork, ETH classic is not.

My question was: Can transactions be undone *without* a fork. That is, for the blockchain that is not the fork. The answer seems to be: No. The only way is to fork (or get literally everyone to agree otherwise, which in practice never, ever happens). And sure, the majority might join the fork (as was the case with ETH), but it remains, technically speaking, a fork.

I mean you can't just throw the whitepaper at me and get properly technical, only to now get all wishy washy on what is and isn't a fork.

My ultimate point here is that crypto-fans love to claim how immutable the blockchain is (and how that's a good thing), when in reality (as you say) it's not nearly as simple. But also, that said non-immutability only works via forking when it comes to the actual, real life use cases (ETH vs. ETH classic, etc.), while individual ""rewinding"" (""Someone stole my NFT!"") is just not happening, ever. And that the original blockchain always remains in some way, too. Which gets kinda sorta really relevant as soon we we talk about NFTs that include personal data. Which just shows that this entire damn tech is just really kind of pointless for all the intended use cases that I've ever seen.",427,hx11oju,t1_hx0y6wk,/r/technology/comments/sslcxv/hacker_couldve_printed_unlimited_ether_but_chose/hx11oju/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,,,0
Reddit_Comments,TurnTM,"&gt;I am not asking if, technically, something is mutable or immutable. I am asking about actual, practical use cases.

Those are actual, practical use-cases because they happen in practice.

But to answer your question: your transactions can only be reversed if you can somehow convince the majority of the network to do that. If only your NFT gets stolen, it's unlikely that the whole network would agree to reverse that transaction just for you. However, if millions of ETH get stolen due to a bug then yes, it's very likely that the majority would agree. This has actually happened and it's why we have Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is the remainder of the nodes who did not agree to revert.

Obviously such a major change would mean that some nodes would not agree and fork the chain. I'm wondering why this is such a big point to you? If a new update for the Ethereum nodes come out and I decide not to update my node, I am technically forking and I would be closer to the ""original"" Ethereum. It's obvious though that all the nodes who updated (the majority) is the real network, not my one node that refused to update.

I think you should look into it more in terms of ""which chain has the most supporters"" and not ""which chain is closest to the original"".",226,hx0y6wk,t1_hx0xbp4,/r/technology/comments/sslcxv/hacker_couldve_printed_unlimited_ether_but_chose/hx0y6wk/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,,,0
Reddit_Comments,__Hello_my_name_is__,"I feel like we are talking about different things here.

Again, the one big selling point of blockchains that keeps being thrown at me is the immutability of it all. And yes, I understand what you are saying. It is not quite that simple, and there are ways (besides forking) where things are undone in some way.

However, what you describe is all part of the whitepaper and the very theory of blockchains. Which is all fine and dandy and, from a technical point of view, pretty damn interesting.

What *I* am talking about is the practical case of undoing an actual transaction. On purpose. Say, Billions of dollars in Etherium get stolen. Can that be undone without a fork?

Say, someone steals my NFT and I don't notice that for a week. Can that be undone without a fork? If so, what has to be done for that to happen?

Reddit_Comments,__Hello_my_name_is__,"I am primarily interested in what can actually happen, not in what might be defined in a whitepaper. There often is a big difference between theory and practice.

Can, say, the bitcoin blockchain rewind a transaction? Not in theory, but in practice. Can this actually happen, without a fork? What, exactly, is required for this to happen?

&gt; In a democracy you wouldn't want your laws to be set in stone, even if they seem like a good idea at first. You want to be able to change them if the majority agrees.

Well, yeah. But I don't quite want the amount of money in my bank account to be defined by the whim of the majority, nor do I want the deed of my house to be dependent on that.

I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just wondering what the point of all this is.

Reddit_Comments,__Hello_my_name_is__,"&gt;  You can know for a fact that certain contracts are totally immutable

Yeah but what if there's a bug in that totally immutable contract? What if it's 10 a year old bug?

&gt; but we‚Äôve developed ways to write code for rocket ships and other such use cases where the code needs to be of extremely high quality.

Not to be a cynic, but I'm not gonna compare literal rocket scientists to people who write smart contracts for a cryptocurrency or NFT, most of them in their free time. There are orders of magnitude in differences right there.

Plus, NASA does not need to worry about their rockets being hacked. They do not publish all their code because why would they? I bet you, 100%, that if they would, the internet would find some bugs. And if people had full access to the rockets *and* the code, they would find ways to make it crash and burn.

Reddit_Comments,WellHydrated,"When you buy an NFT you can identify precisely and uniquely what you are paying for. So it's not really relevant. The value comes from the identity of the seller, and that cannot be impersonated, outside of stealing private keys. If someone wants to pay a million for it then that's on them - they have all the data transparently available to make that decision.

If you did something dubious like stole someone's keys, minted and sold some NFTs acting as that person, and transferred the sale revenue to your wallet - you should definitely be afraid of your door being busted down.

Majorly so if you are doing similar fraudulent activities around cryptocurrency. The SEC treats crypto as securities, they are even taxed in such a way. It would be like breaking into a share registry and assigning some fake Apple shares to your name.

But the thing is that, even though it's not black and white, the govt can slap anything if they (I'd assume IRS and SEC) feels too strongly about this. Surely if he tries to convert it to USD, he can be charged for laundering money. Really depends how they draft up the case and perspectives.

If anything, the concept of block chain, and on top of it, smart contracts on block chains, to a novice, is gonna take time. So it's very easy to persuade a jury and senate that ""using flaw to get legit ether"" = ""hAcKeR"" and ""Stealing Money!! 1!""

Reddit_Comments,7point7,"I‚Äôm in the middle of lunch break so not too much time to respond to each point. Yea, in many areas I conflate blockchain and crypto but from what I‚Äôve seen the two are linked. Blockchain transactions are associated with token values to process the value of transaction from one owner of an asset to the next. You could do it with USD, and many, like NBA Top Shots, does just that. However the consumer Choice of using crypto would be what I‚Äôd argue is the biggest change to society so far. People aren‚Äôt tied to just one currency and it‚Äôs like real-time forex trading in a digital world.

On that point - I think you calling NFTs ‚Äúthe cream of the crop of bullshit is misinformed.

Reddit_Comments,-timenotspace-,"""the idea behind bitcoin"" was decentralization and immutability

&amp;#x200B;

these principles now apply to the internet itself. decentralized applications can be written. the processing and evaluation of their functions is decentralized and verified and immutable. this is what ethereum is / does

&amp;#x200B;

don't use volatile cryptos if you're looking for a store of value. use volatile if you're making plays and seeking to be a 'trader,' use stablecoins if you're looking to store value. and speaking of value, any single human can now use decentralized finance protocols and applications to do with their money what banks do with their money. except instead of letting the banks do it behind the scenes and keep all the profit, the individuals are directly rewarded proportional to their investment. this is the real benefit of 'being your own bank' because banks just profit off of their members.

&amp;#x200B;

many cryptos are volatile, but stablecoins like USDC are pegged to the USD and can be used to buy groceries (or you can convert whatever amount of whatever you. need into USDC at the time of purchase)

&amp;#x200B;

you also say there shouldn't be 1000 different digital currencies, but i ask you how many companies there are? how many websites? how many different applications? there are definitely uses for application-specific tokens, each has a different use case they're not all just value speculations. NFTs have utility now, and certain features of a d-App or product can't be used or accessed unless you validate yourself as the holder (which is verified, immutable, and trustless)

&amp;#x200B;

it's also open, any project can build off of any other. this is open source reaching its peak. this is the next step of the internet's evolution. web2 (client-server model) -&gt; web3 (decentralized applications)

&amp;#x200B;

The idea behind bitcoin didn't get corrupted, it evolved and expanded into other relevant areas as the technology developed and new innovative thinkers got their hands on it and began to wrap their minds around its capabilities

&amp;#x200B;

and the government wants money, yes, but they also don't want to stifle innovation. and this is why developers, stakers, and validators are not being considered 'brokers' under the latest cryptocurrency provisions of the big act they passed

&amp;#x200B;

*Rrrrriiiiiiiigghhhttttttt......* (in Dr. Evil voice)

Somehow I don't see MoviePass decentralizing anything it offers (blockchain), nor allowing users to exchange movie credits without moderation (NFTs).

More likely they are going to use an off-the-shelf distributed database (and call it blockchain-like storage) and use it to store user account information like non-transferrable credits (and call them NFTs). The names are just to sucker in dumb VCs who don't actually have any idea what these things are.

In fact, I'm guessing there's going to be a wave of companies calling user credits ""NFTs"". My Audible credits are definitely not ""NFTs"" as people understand them. But technically they are non-fungible (each one is unique as they expire on different days) and they are tokens (not directly associated with currency).

At the time, Kulechov told Decrypt, ""We believe that content creators should own their audiences in a permissionless fashion, where anyone can build new user experiences by using the same on-chain social graph and data."" He added that Twitter users don't own their audience, pointing out that ""Twitter makes all the revenue from your tweets and the content you share, and Twitter decides which of your tweets get traction through the algorithm.""

Kulechov argued that Twitter doesn't allow its users to monetize their tweets and retweets and that if a user moves to another platform, they have to ""start from scratch.""

Reddit_Comments,cubs223425,"That's where the subscription model comes in. It's why car makers are starting to look into subscriptions for nonsense like heated seats and unlocking your car. It's why game companies are hopping on microtransactions and paid DLC and NFTs.

If you're Peloton, you're initially selling someone a $1,500 bike. From there, you're charging $40/month ($480/year, if you're lazy) to generate perpetual income. Is that enough annual income when the hardware sales slow? That's what they have to decide. Now, what if it's not?

They can slow hardware manufacturing, cutting production costs. They can do like Netflix (and others) where they raise the subscription cost to increase revenue. Alternatively, they could do something like in gaming, where you get a digital avatar and buy cosmetics that your avatar can wear in a class, if they wanted.

They could also try to sell hardware customization. Make easily replaceable pedals and seats and handlebars. Sell someone that $1,500 base bike, then let them optionally pay $50 for blue pedals or $100 for a green seat. The downside to this strategy is that people love showing off their custom hardware, but biking at home doesn't really allow that (hence my suggestion of a digital avatar).

They either have to cut costs (easily done if you lay off manufacturing staff when that process slows), increase the existing revenue costs, or create new sources of revenue.",226,hw4b38m,t1_hw3jvqt,/r/technology/comments/snm4vx/as_peloton_fires_over_2800_employees_its_giving/hw4b38m/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,public,0

Reddit_Comments,opelit,"For example, **Game Keys NFT's**.

Your game key would be stored in NFT. In the current market, you do not own the game anyway, just a key. So no loss for you, while your key can not be removed when they stop support the game. But let's go further.

Issue with current **game keys. -- can't be sold**.  
Issue #2, why? -- because **devs can not monetize it** = their loss.

NFT would solve both of them. **NFT can be traded,** and Devs would be able to monetize even transaction between players. *As Owner and these who process the transaction, as well as these who verify that transaction, gets a % of the value that the NFT has been sold.*

NFT are speculation in nature. It's another reason why Devs would add more Unique game keys, like limited editions. Let's say they would sell 50 keys that also would allow you to play as your 'Metaverse you' -- bringing real value to your purchase, not just 'because it NFT'. And now Keanu Reeves sell it's key that also allow you to play as him. -- how much would you pay?

Let's say 10 000$. Let's say it's UbiSoft game, as they first wanted to do NFT -- in a shit way -- trying to just earn more money from selling the same for more -- lol.

From the 10 000$ transaction, Ubi would earn, probably more than from selling the limited key. Meanwhile, you have a copy of a game that allow you to play as a popular man.

A lot of rumours on some parts of the Internet that GameStop and Microsoft are extending their already established partnership into the Web3 space. This comment from Microsoft is more confirmation bias along those lines. Microsoft are definitely looking at getting into blockchain tech. 

Gamestop have already confirmed there are projects underway with Loopring and Immutable X. It makes sense that GameStop try and push into the NFT space and develop a new market for digital items. I know a lot of people are really downbeat on NFT's in gaming, but I think they miss the point. All those skins, guns, armours, cards that people pump money into on games like Call of Duty and Fortnite are essentially worthless. Imagine if you could trade them with others or sell them on when you leave a game. With NFT linked cosmetics you actually have ownership of the items - the marketplace takes their cut and the creators and owners get theirs.

&gt; The group, which is starting a new marketplace for non-fungible tokens called the Color Museum, has quickly garnered online interest since launching its presale waitlist.

&gt; The concept is what Omar Farooq, the 31-year-old leader of the collective, refers to as &amp;quot;a meta NFT,&amp;quot; meaning that by owning the rights to a specific color, people stand to earn &amp;quot;Royalties&amp;quot; each time a NFT image that uses that color is sold through the marketplace.

&gt; Farooq believes his Color Museum offers hope for a more communal form of capitalism, where financial gains are not hoarded by the few and instead more evenly distributed throughout the web-in this case, to the 10,000 people holding the NFTs. Farooq sees the Color Museum as a competitor to OpenSea, the dominant NFT marketplace.

The existence of NFT's is basically a tech tree that's begging to be used but I'm sure Meta will ignore it in favor of attempting to own and control everything in their virtual landscape.

What I'd love to see in the short term is the ability for artists to plant a ""permanent"" object of their ""original"" work in the virtual landscape tied to an NFT (like a virtual museum). And the ability to/use and see such works in augmented reality.

Unfortunately the nature of the Internet encourages things to be temporary, reproducible, and meaningless. For example, I can't imagine how something like a Bansky work could ever exist in such a corporate-controlled platform.

Reddit_Comments,FactAffectionate1397,"I think some of y‚Äôall look at the metaverse in too much of a black/white fashion. IMO the metaverse is going to be much more of a grey concept.

I think the companies that focus on designing a/the metaverse around monetizing people‚Äôs free time rather than function. 

I also think of the metaverse as something broader than a VR experience. IMO If you are on a digital environment spending time socializing, buying things, expressing your identity (personalization) then you are in the metaverse. 

Having said that all that, I think gaming companies have a massive head start on designing digital environments that people enjoy and actually want to be in. Games like GTA, Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, Warzone, Halo, are already addicting af and extremely immersive. There‚Äôs already gaming companies experimenting with play to earn and assigning ownership to digital assets within the game (nfts). 

I think that companies that focus on a metaverse directed towards function and productivity are going to find themselves playing within a very narrow scope and maybe finding out that the metaverse is not well suited to improve a lot of ‚Äúwork‚Äù environments.

This is such a great point.

The first digital cameras were potato quality but there were uses for them immediately, they were immediately useful.

The early web. Early social networks. Early cell phones. Early electric cars.

They were all primitive but they worked and people wanted them.

The Metaverse is none of those things. It's a solution looking for a problem.

Reddit_Comments,_30d_,"That's definitely true in this case.

I think we will start to see banks with better and cheaper service for example, offering higher rates or more versatile investment possibilities. That kind of boring more nuanced stuff.

The idea behind the metaverse as Meta presents it is an exaggeration of the idea that people live half their lives on the internet. The NFT hype is a speculation on the idea that people will like to show off status stuff (like sneakers, cars, clothes etc) online just as in real life. Easiest way to visualize that is this second life vision. Digital dudes running around with expensive sneakers. 

I have no doubt that we will spend more money on our digital identity as time goes by, but I can't possibly imagine it would be with $400 digital shoes. A single personalized twitter pic?

Rather I see a use in NFT‚Äôs in the real estate area. Where someone could more quickly verify if someone owns a house and is able to sell it. This could be for example a third party real estate company. A group of people can choose to put their house on the chain by signing some kind of contract with the company that the house deed becomes linked to the NFT. What‚Äôs in it for the company someone might ask. Well on some chains like chia the company can choose to set a fee for every time the NFT is traded. This could potentially be lower then normal because real estate could now cost less time to complete. 
The fee for the company could also be set to a % of the sale price.

Reddit_Comments,do-it-for-jonny,"Ownership. An NFT is proof of ownership of... well, anything. In this case it would be the sword. Just leveraging a blockchain to prove that (outside of any actual game play mechanics)

The game maker can make every rare item (or every item) be an NFT, once you win/earn/pick up any item, it's yours. You can keep/use/sell it at your discretion. Games can have built-in marketplaces or players can sell on external marketplaces.  


Hopefully down the road games will be interoperable and you might be able to use some NFT's across games. Connect your wallet and just have it as an option to use it.  


Buy why do that?  
Think economic models. Cartridge games were sold per unit and were self contained, easily sold and resold by the owners. Second hand gaming stores materialized as new businesses. That evolved into downloadable games which were not easily sold or transferred, but were upgraded through patches giving game developers ways to get more income. But the second hand stores took a hit.

With mobile they tried to sell $60 apps but none wanted to pay that, so freemium became a thing. Free games, but you have to pay to play or pay to upgrade. 

So what's next?

Game makers want revenue, they want RECURRING revenue. Businesses love subscriptions and anything that can give them steady income. That what NFT's can do.

Anyone that creates an NFT can set up a royalty. So every time that NFT is sold, they get a cut. So a game company is generating tens of thousands of NFT items for players of their game, markets for trading and selling these items form, every sale they get a cut.   


They could give the game away for free, pay their developers, make a profit and have a flood of money coming in just from the royalties. That's a win for the company,

Players get to own their items and can buy/sell them on the open market - that's a win for players.

Just a matter of time before that economic model takes off.",343,i2rf7vk,t1_i2jir23,/r/technews/comments/tqk739/ukraine_has_launched_an_nft_museum_to_preserve/i2rf7vk/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Reddit_Comments,SeventhSolar,"I play PoE.  The microtransaction structure incentivized the developers to eventually introduce a lootbox.  It was an incredibly stripped down implementation, about as non-exploitative as the developers could make it, and we trust the developers implicity.  The relationship between PoE players and devs is stronger than in most games, and *that's* why there's only light grumbling about the lootboxes.  It's not *liked*, but it's accepted as mostly inoffensive.  We buy the microtransactions with the mindset that PoE is an incredible game and we're willing to spend hundreds of dollars on meaningless skins to support the devs.  Microtransactions are a sacrifice, something distasteful that we accept as inevitable for any business looking to make more money.  It's anti-player, but the shareholders want more money.

Yes, RMT exists, and developers spend massive amounts of effort stamping it out.  RMT is harmful to any game it touches, and developers would be insane to explicitly support it.  If a real developer sold items as NFTs for some reason, they would definitely code either the game or the NFT to invalidate the item if the player ever sold it.",192,i2l7p66,t1_i2kb4ey,/r/technews/comments/tqk739/ukraine_has_launched_an_nft_museum_to_preserve/i2l7p66/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Tobydog30,"The only ways to make money off NFTs is to: 

1. Get in early to a limited drop that is from a big brand. These sell out very quickly and then the price begins to rise once there are no more in stock. Then you sell it to someone who thinks they can still flip it for profit. This is pretty hard to do since they sell out very fast. Then you need to time the sell because the hype dies down fast. I‚Äôm also pretty sure the only reason these have any ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is because the brands releasing them are big and established such as luxury fashion brands. 

2. Make your own NFT collection. Gameify it since those seem to do better than artistic ones. Build hype around it and sell them for about $50-100 a piece. Hopefully people bite the bait and you make some sort of profit.

Personally I think NFT‚Äôs are really dumb. Blockchain technology is great and I think that has many potential good uses. NFTs are not one of them in my opinion. 

The receipt that you get for purchasing an NFT doesn‚Äôt even include the NFT, simply a date, maybe some credentials and a pointer to where the image is located. Basically it‚Äôs a receipt with a url on it. 

If the server that hosts that url goes down, if someone changes what content is on the domain that the url points to, etc. Your ‚ÄúNFT‚Äù is gone.

Most of the marketing surrounding NFTs is based on the claim that such technologies do away with third parties, allowing sellers to interact directly with each other.

Reddit_Comments,do-it-for-jonny,"Incorrect. An NFT cannot be copied. It is a unique identifier on a blockchain. Verifiable. Unique.

It is basically a row in a spreadsheet linking ownership, in the form of a receipt to something at a specific address. Which could be anything.

A deed to a house, a certificate. A document. A picture of a stoned monkey. Anything. Even identical images are unique through NFT ID‚Äôs.

An NFT is by definition a Non-Fungible Token, not the jpeg of some random art collection. That art is represented by the token on the chain. It‚Äôs a receipt pointing to an asset.

The asset can be right clicked or screenshot. Sure. But you don‚Äôt own it. Proof of ownership is on-chain.

This preliminary use case of AI generated art with artificial ‚Äúrarity‚Äù in a collection is a fad. It will subside as better use cases take hold. You can see it fading already. A few winners have emerged, the rest are sad copies.

Look at Bored Apes and Crypto Punks, they give the holder the copyrights to the images, a membership into an exclusive club and all kinds of other perks. Enough people find value in that to think they are worth six figures today. Maybe that‚Äôs cheap to the real potential‚Ä¶ or maybe they are worth $5. The market decides. They aren‚Äôt jpegs, they are memberships with perks that have jpegs on their cards.

End of the day it doesn‚Äôt matter if any of us ‚Äúget it‚Äù, those that do are making bank.

NFT‚Äôs solve the problem of digital ownership.

Oh, This will be huge in gaming. You own item 65323789655? Great. The game called that the Sword of Doom. There are 5. It‚Äôs super rare. So you can sell it on an open market or have your character use it. Maybe you get an upgrade down the road. Instead of selling to an NPC, you recoup value from your time with real money from another player. Wish I could do that in a simple way back when I played WoW. Players spend time earning items, the ability to sell the rewards of that hard work will be pretty popular once that is implemented correctly by good games.

But the pretty jpeg with numbers thing, is that why people are buying? Or are they joining like-minded communities of people? NFT generative art is exposing some interesting trends and are very tribal.

Who knows what happens but I don't think people should also be too quick to dismiss it.

I think the speculation with the current wave of NFTs will fade with time, but maybe they won't. If they won't, then it's up to the owners of the asset to increase it's desirability over time as to raise the floor price. If we don't jump on board, then the floor price has reached its peak and may start to fall. Then it's just a matter of demand vs. supply, it always has been.

Because if nuclear war breaks out, we're all dead! It won't matter how things are preserved. 

Attempting to ""preserve"" anything as an NFT isn't going to do a better job than any other form of preservation.

And, again, NFTs are not stored on the blockchain. They're stored no differently from a JPEG on a website.

However, it's worse than a JPEG because the blockchain uses unnecessary levels of computing power and pollution in order to run it &amp; check ownership. 

The current books, artwork, and other historical items &amp; info that needs to be preserved already exist. 
Any of the remaining important historical pieces need to be kept as far out of Russia's reach as possible.

An NFT won't preserve info better than how we currently preserve info.

I‚Äôm not sure why NFTs have made you so angry. As I‚Äôve pointed out in other parts of the thread, NFTs are just a general form of technology that can be used for many different things.

Reddit_Comments,Sanuzi,"Oh, I didn't know it reduces the complexity of the puzzle too. That's pretty cool. Where did you see that btw?

Ah yes. As for nfts, I'll first touch on the issues with the images. The big issue with using nfts to point to an http link, is as you would expect, that link can go down, or it can be changed without any record of what, or why, or by who. Enter a new decentralized concept; decentralized file systems. These are mechanisms that provide decentralized data storage off chain (I. E not on any blockchain). IPFS for example. It is a peer to peer protocol, providing decentralized data storage via user nodes that hold a portion of the shared data. The only way to view (or host) files on the network is to act as a node, so the incentive is there. Once a file is uploaded, it's accessible via an ID that can never change. These sort of technologies allow for direct ownership of images, since the hyperlink in this case can't go down. It been adopted widely yet though, so it's WIP

As for using nfts for everything. Yes, this is possible. The basic concept of an nft is that each one has a completely unique ID assigned to it, making it indistinguishable from the rest. If a blockchain technology supporting nfts exists that a whooe industry buys into, companies within that industry can create nfts to denote legally binding contracts, including ownership of real world objects. There may not be any need to link to any data off chain in this case, instead including some metadata in the nft itself detailing what the token itself represents. That's my understanding of it anyways",284,i2bdi0e,t1_i273v98,/r/technews/comments/tom9ky/ukraine_is_selling_nfts_to_support_its_military/i2bdi0e/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Reddit_Comments,FaceDeer,"&gt; Uh, first, the ability to sell tickets directly to fans as existed long before NFTs were ever around. 

Sure, but this would be a new way of doing it that supports features that the older ways did not. NFTs can be transferred directly over the internet in a fraud-proof manner, most obviously. That's their core feature.

&gt; Second, people have been talking about displacing Ticketmaster for decades.

I don't know what point you're trying to make here. I'm not saying Ticketmaster would necessarily be completely obsoleted by NFTs, lock stock and barrel. I'm saying that NFTs can support an alternative to Ticketmaster. If Ticketmaster's services provide sufficient value-add that it's worth the fees to use them, then sure, go ahead and use them. Otherwise, sell your tickets some other way. Maybe as NFTs.

The goal isn't to drive Ticketmaster out of business, it's to give people more tools in their toolbox. If Ticketmaster can't compete with them, oh well, too bad for Ticketmaster. If it can, all the better - it means Ticketmaster's providing good value. Competition is good, yes?

And I should note, this is all still just one single example off the top of my head of a useful application of NFTs. If somehow it turns out that Ticketmaster is just so incredibly awesome and cheap that everyone always uses them forevermore, and would have been even if there wasn't the possibility of competition from NFT tickets, that still doesn't necessarily mean NFTs are useless overall. There's other applications. This is just the first one that popped to my mind in particular.

&gt; What you‚Äôre saying is eerily reminiscent of what people called ‚Äúopen-source businesses‚Äù that Bitcoin would make possible.

It is reminiscent of that because it's the same basic thing. The difference is that Bitcoin failed to accomplish it. Bitcoin is not technologically sophisticated enough to support the sorts of applications needed for replacing middlemen like these, and the userbase of Bitcoin became too conservative to continue developing the new features that were necessary to do this. Bitcoin ossified into its current ""digital gold"" form that's fairly useless for anything except price speculation.

Bitcoin doesn't support smart contracts or NFTs like modern blockchains do. So obviously, it can't do these sorts of things that are now more easily possible via smart contracts and NFTs. That's why NFTs have suddenly become popular now, as opposed to back in 2013. The technology didn't support them very well back in 2013. The possibility was anticipated, it just happened to be realized by blockchains other than Bitcoin itself.",421,i29cyyq,t1_i299cy5,/r/technews/comments/tom9ky/ukraine_is_selling_nfts_to_support_its_military/i29cyyq/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Yes, plagiarism and copyright issues have existed in the art world forever. But we're seeing theft on a scale that is unprecedented and the easiest targets are those who have massive online portfolio of work where anyone can anonymously mint and sell these works without consulting the person who made the art.

These marketplaces need to do a better job protecting the rights of artists who have their work minted against their will. Instead the onus is being placed on artists to find and report their own art as stolen. The artist has to do more to prove the stolen art is theirs than the thief who minted it in the first place.",153,i28t6f9,t1_i28kr44,/r/technews/comments/tom9ky/ukraine_is_selling_nfts_to_support_its_military/i28t6f9/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

But blockchains got pushed heavily into the public with the crypto boom. Imo that was a bad first step but crypto got the attention it wanted.

I have really not much clue about blockchains and NFTs, I can imagine the technical workings and the pros cons of it but nothing of detail.

What does this even mean? This is literally a number you pulled out of your ass.

&gt;Seriously, I'd get behind NFTs if there weren't so many scams and worthless shitty art going around in the market

So if say it had backing by a reputable company? Because that‚Äôs happening and the ‚ÄúiTs a ScAm‚Äù isn‚Äôt cutting it as an excuse anymore.

&gt;As for obssession, I think anyone who takes (even unvalid and mean-spirited) criticism this way is at least a bit obssessed.

Reddit_Comments,FaceDeer,"The complexity would need to be hidden behind a user-friendly interface if such a thing were to see general usage, of course. Just like how when people post a comment on Reddit they don't need to know anything about how HTTP or SSL works or what a HTTP POST operation does, their browser just presents them a box to type in and a button to click when they're done.

According to [this Quora post](https://www.quora.com/Do-you-have-to-pay-a-fee-to-sell-tickets-on-Ticketmaster) Ticketmaster takes a roughly 10% cut off of tickets sold through them, including tickets resold by fans. An NFT ticket marketplace could bypass that middleman, so once the technology becomes user-friendly enough there'll be a real monetary incentive for people to make use of it. The complexity of the blockchain will be needed to replace the things that Ticketmaster currently does behind the scenes. It's early days for the technology, though, so the user-friendliness necessary for that sort of mass-market application just isn't quite there yet.

Reddit_Comments,FaceDeer,"I'll give an actual answer. NFT stands for ""non-fungible token."" [Fungibility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fungibility.asp) is ""the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type.""

For example if you have a dollar and I have a dollar and we put them in a pile together it doesn't mater which dollar was mine and which was yours - dollars are fungible. If we put the keys to our cars in a pile, though, it *does* matter which key is which. Car keys are not fungible.

You can have this in cryptocurrency as well. Fungible tokens are things like Bitcoin, where the ""identity"" of any given bitcoin token doesn't matter. If I sell something for X bitcoin tokens I don't care *which* tokens I get, as long as I get X amount of them.

Non-fungible tokens actually ""represent"" a specific unique thing in some manner. For example, you could have an NFT that represents a specific seat in a stadium for a specific sporting event. If you own that token they'll let you into the stadium to view the event, if you don't own that token you won't be allowed in.

Right now most NFTs on the market are of less practical utility than that, they're generally treated more as ""trading cards"". People ""mint"" NFTs that represent abstract things, like a particular image or event, and then sell them to people who simply want to be able to say ""I own the NFT representing that thing and nobody else does."" It's an application that's ripe for abuse, unfortunately, so it's resulted in the term getting a rather tarnished public image.

Reddit_Comments,_ArtosisCurse_,"Good on you for not seeing the world in black and white like to many other people do. 

NFTs and crypto are so hyped right now many people (who often dont know much about the subject) talk about it all the time. But the are just hyped which i can respect. I honestly find it much more cringe that there are so many people who absolutley hate crypto/nfts and yet spend so much time thinking and talking about it, what a waste of time.

No nfts or crypto will not solve every problem and they never were intended to do so but they can help us solve some problems and allready do. 

Game studios would be interessted in turing their items into nfts if it attracted more players, i for example made the switch for hearthstone to gods unchained for mostly that reason. If i spend a lot of money on digital cards i want to atleast actually own them.

The steam marketplace is a perfect example of how not to do it because you can only sell items for money which is then stuck on steam no way to withdraw to the real world without going through and trusting very very shady thrid party websites. The biggest advantage of the blockchain is that it solves the issue of you needing to trust the system which stores your value.",227,i276bp7,t1_i274gqg,/r/technews/comments/tom9ky/ukraine_is_selling_nfts_to_support_its_military/i276bp7/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

I think NFTs have a few very specialized use cases. Stuff like tickets are one of them. I don't think they're evil.

I just hate seeing people try to ram them into every conceivable corner of the market. 

You're doing it to some extent. 

For games, why would a studio implement an NFT system for trading their items if they did not want players selling them? As an example the steam marketplace exists, and there are lots of third party trading sites, moreover a company could choose to integrate a system like that using a traditional database and it would be more efficient than NFTs (though it would still be centralized. . . then again, the value assigned to the object is based on a centralized game so I don't really see that as a problem)

Reddit_Comments,_ArtosisCurse_,"Weil that would be a fucking long ass comment but I will try to keep this short. 

NFTs allow you to own digital items. This is becoming important in a time where we spend our lives increasingly online. Web 1 only allowed you to read and watch the stuff other people out online, web 2 allowed you to interact with things like Reddit and web 3 will allow you not only to interact but also own the content you created. Social media earn millions on the back of content creators who get jack shit, NFTs can help change that. 

They can also be used to make quite a few existing systems much more faire. For example tickets which could be created as NFTs in a way that they can not be resold thus helping to fight people who buy in bulk to screw over fans. 

They could also help improve the position of gamers. Gamers spend more and more money every year on digital items that they have zero control over and often can‚Äôt even resell. Items as NFTs would allow you to trade them on any market you wanted to and to get some of your money back once you decide to leave the game. 

There current uses cases of ugly jpegs is pretty cringe and scammy but honestly so is the traditional art market.

Reddit_Comments,ArchangelLBC,"So I think currently the problem is that all the chains are, by their nature, hard to change. The easiest way to iterate is to create a new chain, rather than trying to upgrade the current one. This is compounded by the fact that the kinds of changes needed aren't obviously to the benefit to the current largest stakeholders. A system which keeps making early adopters theoretically richer, and can also only be changed with their consent isn't likely to evolve all that quickly.

 If the future economy is run on a blockchain, I feel confident in saying it will not be any of the current chains.

Also I see a huge fundamental problem when enthusiasts talk about putting things like house deeds and other proofs of  ownership of physical assets on blockchains: you will require a government to enforce that ownership. For example let's say you sell your house and you signify the sale by minting an NFT of the deed and transferring it. And then let's say you do it again on a different chain (because the double spend problem is at best only solved within a chain, not across chains). Who really owns the house? If both buyers claim ownership how do we decide who is right? Involving a court of law is appealing to a central authority and ultimately gets us back to exactly where we claimed we were trying to get from.

Reddit_Comments,ResoluteClover,"So crypto is a lot of things. 

Bitcoin, for example is 100% centralized and the transaction approval process is completely automated and punisher latecomers to the mining process. They call it ""decentralized"" but it's really just cloned.

They're all similar to this -- Ethereum allows you to dispute transactions by forking the chain... But then you might just have two chains for eternity, which is where Ethereum classic came from. 

 And call me crazy, but by removing banks, which are regulated, from the lending process sounds a lot like ""loan sharks"" to me. You can do that right now without crypto and ""defi"". I'm sure the results will be similar. 

It's also like go fund me. None of this is actually new stuff, is just rebranded to make it sound new when it's actually just a clone of the current market except you can't buy anything with it.

Reddit_Comments,--SOURCE--,"The math there is my issue. 5 people bought the game and the dev only made $76, whereas in Steam even with their current 30% cut, the dev would have made $210 after 5 sales. You could argue that maybe because the price is cheaper, it would attract more players and thus more sales occurring. But the flip side is Steam itself is an active, reputable market with millions of users, indie devs will get more eyes on their product on Steam vs going solo and paying for advertising. 

This would probably impact story based games a lot more too. If Elden Ring was a NFT for example, they'd get 1M purchases or so first month with no cut which is obviously a huge amount of money. But down the road as people finish the game and choose to sell, there will be a point where the demand for the game is less than the number of NFTs in circulation. NFT resale market will become increasingly competitive, driving NFT prices down, giving even less reason to directly buy from the dev. Games that are expected to have a 2 to 3 year life cycle will see profits come to a trickle within the first year. 

Not saying NFTs has no place in gaming, I think the technology has potential, I'm just wary after seeing the way it has been handled in the art world.

Reddit_Comments,ZXFT,"Distributors would hate it, absolutely. That's their whole business model!

The attraction is on the development-side. Why go to market in traditional channels via a distributor when you could go direct to the consumer with an NFT? The resale could be structured such that the developers receive kickbacks in resales, maybe take 15% since that's been working **extremely** well for Steam. The supply isn't unlimited. The only way to create a new NFT licence would be to purchase it at full list price. I personally have games that I would resell if I could, but I also have tons of games I wouldn't because I love them and may go back to them or maybe I bought my copy for $40 and it's worth $10 on the market and it's worth $8.50 to me to keep it (15% fee).

It's hard to say how this looks financially, but i could see a market force imposed on traditional channels like what we saw with music albums changing from physical to digital to streaming. Maybe the dev sees one NFT sell at $60, $40, $20, then $10 five times for a gross revenue of the original $60 plus $16.5 in trade commissions. If that lands more money in their pocket vs what it costs to use whatever traditional channels, then devs might start going NFT-only or something. Again, we're very early in the adoption process and it's hard to say exactly what it will shake out to be, but I think it's a huge thing coming.",252,hyttsme,t1_hytq2m1,/r/technews/comments/t3gx2u/ukraine_government_raises_over_10_million_in/hyttsme/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Inflation is normal and a deflationary store of wealth comes with a whole host of problems. There is a finite supply of BTC and that poses a serious risk for people who can't buy in. Like people who aren't born yet.

My interest rate on my loan is 3.25%. it's pretty damn good. I don't think we should lend money using only code. Who wrote it? Is it reputable? Is the other party reputable? How do I vet an investment like that? I work in software. This sounds terrifying.

Digital collectables aren't new and NFTs are built on a backbone that is rife with scams and corruption.

Btc is a hedge against inflation as a limited digital gold. Ethereum is currently hosting 1000+ dapps some of which have billions of dollars in total value locked. There are lending protocols so you can lend your crypto and get interest and get a way better rate than the bank because you're cutting out the middle man. Banks give you trash interest but charge you a lot for a loan. This gets rid of that and we can actually loan out our money through code and get the interest we deserve. 

GameStop and their soon to be NFT marketplace so we can own and sell our digital assets and let game developers hook into an easy to use trading system that gives them royalties everytime their item is sold.

Reddit_Comments,ZXFT,"NFTs could be anything that you don't want duplicated and you're currently relying on a middle man to secure and verify in transactions. 

This could be a movie rental like old-school Blockbuster. You rent the NFT which has an embedded use period, say a 14 day rental, during which you can view the movie. It's authenticating ownership for access to content in this case. This has the added benefit of working like a physical copy that's digital. Maybe you rent it, watch it, but aren't out of time so you lend it to a buddy for a couple of days. 

Maybe it's a game you buy, play through, and resell to someone else when you're done and the creator can get ""in"" on the resales. This would attract creators away from traditional means of game distribution, like it's current state of only new sales and no transferability. It works now, but what if there's no Steam-equivalent dominance because indie creators (hell, could even be AAA studios) start applying a direct-to-consumer model now that they don't need to manage licencing since that's on the blockchain. Yeah, the blockchain does cost money to interact with, but so does every financial system out there... Steam takes a 15% fee for peer-to-peer item sales for example.

Maybe it's a car title. Maybe it's a membership card (e.g. Costco). Maybe it's *anything* that you want to track individually without replication potential. 

We're too early in the applications to see how and where this will be implemented fully. Things are gonna look funny and there will be big busts from here to full integration, but I can easily envision a future where you and I use NFTs daily without knowing since they could be embedded into products and services without you personally needing to know how/why you use them.",302,hytk8a0,t1_hytaktj,/r/technews/comments/t3gx2u/ukraine_government_raises_over_10_million_in/hytk8a0/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

People who have crypto can't just sell it all for real money because it will tank, they need new suckers to buy in so they can get real money and further legitimize it. All these extra side schemes are in place to make people buy crypto, which means give them actual money for something they are telling you is worth the real money. If you give them that money then they are right, but the problem is being passed on to you, who now has to find another person down the road to give you real money when your virtual money is worth more.

Just in case anyone didn't know, the music industry has been growing for the last 7-8 years especially with the rise of streaming (which has it's own problems but that's not the current argument).

It very clearly is doing fine without introducing a predatory, wasteful and downright idiotic NFT model to shoehorn in.

NFTs are a nascent technology and the space has issues with plagiarism, making it kinda like the Wild West

Solutions are being worked on, some are already helping significantly like with Rarible

As more developers enter the space as well as money and attention a more secure market will emerge with less plagiarism

Reddit_Comments,kameecoding,"&gt; Because steam already exists dude. They did it, good luck making a carbon copy and expecting anyone uses it. 

exactly my point why NFT marketplace is worthless.

&gt;  Like Fortnite... If Fortnite wants to trade, what would they do? They're too big to give their money to steam and I have a hard time believing it's worth for a single game to spend millions creating their own trading platform. 

are you fucking kidding me? The company behind fortnite literally created a steam competitor in Epic Games, but all of a sudden it's a stretch they introduce a marketplace?

&gt;centralized solutions

yeah, because when something relies on the existing of Ethereum that's not centralized at all

&gt; Imagine if they could use eth? Much cheaper than the cut steam takes.

proof?

I am just gonna literally start using Hitchen's razor now, because you keep making statements like these without any basis in reality.

Thing is though mate, we don't have argue about this, if it's economically viable NFT game item marketplaces will happen, if it isn't, they won't, or rather they will exist for a while, then it will crash.

So I guess that's my final sentence to you.",192,hy0xcf8,t1_hy0tjwb,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hy0xcf8/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0
Reddit_Comments,kameecoding,"&gt; engineering is all about using the right tool for the right job. 

No, Software engineering is about finding solutions within the given budget (both time and money).

&gt;  Use the right tool for the job and the blockchain excels at ownership rights and transactions. 

you see, but you start from the assumption that you are the owner of these items, who told you that? did you read ToS? you don't even own your games you paid for, you have a license to use it that can be revoked if your break ToS, that's why Valve can ban you from their platform.

&gt; But no, it's always you need to give me a 20 page paper why it's reasonable to even consider it. 

I am not saying it's not worth considering, what the hell is this discussion about, I am saying it's not gonna happen, for various reasons, it might be perfect technology, it grants you ownership of stuff you paid for  etc.

But there is no incentive for companies to use it.

it being tied to cryptos makes it worthless, since cryptos are an unusable currency.

&gt; It's faster dev time

how do you know? have you ever released game items to the steam marketplace? did you ever release nft items?


&gt; it's millions of dollars saved

you have literally no basis for that estimate

&gt; the nft marketplace creators don't pay for servers

Neither do steam marketplace users

&gt; it's 10000s of times more secure, etc.

and when was the last time your steam account was straight up hacked?

as in you didn't leak your password online, you didn't get phished, your account just go hacked, brute forced?

What exactly do you need security from? all the ways steam accounts get hacked, your wallet is susceptible too, the difference being if your steam account gets hacked there is support to get your shit back, if your nft holding wallet gets hacked and your shit transferred you are shit out of luck, so where is this security coming from?",328,hy0vj8k,t1_hy0t115,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hy0vj8k/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0
Reddit_Comments,anlskjdfiajelf,"&gt;but then here comes the real question, why not just create all this centralized trading platform for game items, without any sort of blockchain technology?


As I explained in my original comment, because it's tremendously easier and faster to build a trading system with the blockchain. Use the right tool for the job and the blockchain excels at ownership rights and transactions. 

People look for ANY justification to not use blockchain instead of looking at it and going hmm. It's a system built for this exact use case. It works and with layer 2 scaling is affordable and therefore not bad for the environment. Why wouldn't we use it?

But no, it's always you need to give me a 20 page paper why it's reasonable to even consider it. It's pretty obvious why it's smart to at least consider it. That's what the system was designed to you and engineering is all about using the right tool for the right job.

Reddit_Comments,kameecoding,"how do you think the steam marketplace started?

Unless my memory betrays me it was literally just Valve games that used it, so they literally just programmed in the feature, then hooked up their games to it, they had Dota 2, CS:GO and TF 2 with a bunch of items, so they just allowed people to sell and buy these things and they a cut from each transaction.

Why couldn't EA just do the same for Fifa Cards, then add in all their sports game into it?

&gt;even steam marketplace at that point. 

yes, why would anyone make NFT items a thing, when they can just use  the steam marketplace.

The only incentive to not use NFT would be if there would be more profit from NFT items, but my gut says their own marketplace would be much more profitable.

ANd it's not really tiny fractured systems, huge publishers can do this and the rest will either use steam marketplace or if their publisher has this than that.

so why is it a braindead take?",170,hy0t0pd,t1_hy0rqvx,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hy0t0pd/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0
Reddit_Comments,anlskjdfiajelf,"&gt;why wouldn't they just create their own little ecosystems that's tied to just their stuff (e.g. Origin, Uplay) 

Ever heard the saying don't reinvent the wheel?


You know how long it took steam to make their trading marketplace? It's not casual dude. 

I could literally make an NFT trading system on the blockchain, it's that easy because that's all the blockchain really does aha. Transfer assets. 


Steam takes a big cut. Steam doesn't let you take money out of their platform. 

The idea that any company who wants in game trading should spin up their entire own system is absurd for so many reasons. 


Not every game is on steam, in fact many aren't from Fortnite, league of legends, etc. These games have no trading because it's a poor business decision to leave their own launcher and partner with steam. Hence they have 0 way to trade without spending multi millions and years building their own centralized trading platform that could never compete with steam because it's specific for their own platform. 


It makes 0 sense man, don't reinvent the wheel. 

1 person makes an easy to use NFT marketplace. Now every game dev can hook into it and use it within hours. Clearly better than every gaming company who wants trading to either get shafted by steams rates, or spend millions and make their own lmfao. 



If you actually care feel free to look into it instead of spending a near equivalent time flaming strangers online lmfao.

Reddit_Comments,doxx_in_the_box,"Your argument:
You: NFT are not useful
Me: well actually (gives uses)
You: yea but they aren‚Äôt used for that
Me: they are, it‚Äôs just not popular
You: but the energy
Me: it‚Äôs being resolved 
You: yea but it‚Äôs not resolved ‚Äúyet‚Äù
Me: gives reason why
You: yea but what‚Äôs the point of NFT 


It‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre arguing except all the garbage your rad about it, and ultimately I gather that youll never buy an NFT. And I probably won‚Äôt either unless it‚Äôs like way cheaper to register or license something down the road.

 I‚Äôd also never buy a baseball card or a Pok√©mon card. I‚Äôd be happy to make money selling them and making people happy for the rare find. 

Seriously what‚Äôs the big deal?",122,hxv1xxn,t1_hxv0vvz,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hxv1xxn/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Reddit_Comments,ScientificBeastMode,"I mean sure, but what you‚Äôre describing as an MLM is not actually what‚Äôs happening in crypto right now. Are NFTs overly hyped? Yes? Would I ever buy a $1M NFT? Hell no, even if I had the money‚Ä¶

But there are numerous examples of people who have a crypto punk or a bored ape who have never sold. Some of them have publicly explained that they really like the NFT, and that it means enough to them that they don‚Äôt ever plan on selling.

An MLM is about direct marketing and direct recruiting. The NFT market is nothing like that. It‚Äôs just not even close. It‚Äôs just an over-hyped asset class, and it‚Äôs only over-hyped because it‚Äôs new and because the insane prices cause quite a buzz in popular culture. That‚Äôs all there is to it.

The fact is, there is no such thing as ‚Äúintrinsic value.‚Äù If intrinsic value were real, then one might think oxygen would be the most valuable thing on earth. And in one sense it is. If we suddenly didn‚Äôt have it, it would become a priceless commodity. But because it‚Äôs plentiful, it‚Äôs basically worthless.

Scarcity and desire are ultimately what drive prices for everything in the world, and ‚Äúdesire‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to have anything to do with ‚Äúusefulness‚Äù or ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù or anything else. Sometimes people just want the digital equivalent of owning a Rolex, something that is worth a lot mostly because it serves as a status symbol. And that‚Äôs not nothing. That‚Äôs pretty rational, tbh. We will see if NFTs retain their ‚Äúcool factor‚Äù over the long term, but there is no denying that they have cultural relevance and that people find them genuinely valuable.",279,hxuvncf,t1_hxuep52,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hxuvncf/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Pancakewagon26,"Well it's harder to explain, but the main reason is that it's a grift.

 Bitcoin hit it's peak value, and it doesn't look like it's ever going to reach that high again. This leaves people feeling like they missed out. 

NFT's are a new thing that grifters are pushing as ""the next big thing"". You'll hear a lot that ""NFT's will change the world! Just invest in on my new NFT project! Look how much theyre already going up in value!"" This makes people eager to throw down large amounts of money, because Bitcoin and ETH went up a shit load in value. This is already going up in value, why wouldn't the trend continue? 

People mint NFT's and say that they're going to use the investment to make a casino, or a video game, or a comic series. 

In reality, the nft projects people invest in almost never go anywhere, they're scams. ""Rugpulls"" the community calls them. And yes, there's a common term, because scams are so common. 

The creators will often trade the NFT's back and forth between wallets they own to make it look like the value is going up. This is called wash trading. Normally it's illegal, but not in the crypto world. 

So in short, why people pay so much for them is that they're convinced they're buying into something new and innovative, when in reality it's just scam.",234,hxus8jr,t1_hxuj5pn,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hxus8jr/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Reddit_Comments,sunlegion,"It‚Äôs funny how NFTs are so polarizing, people get so worked up about it. Yet it‚Äôs nothing new. Anything is worth nothing and whatever the buyer is willing to pay. This argument has been played as nauseum about art, is a piece of linen with oiled up crushed rock pigments arranged in a pattern worth millions? Is it just the materials? Is the artist name? Is it a scam by gallerists and auctioneers? Is a baseball card or postage stamp worth anything other than the paper it‚Äôs printed on? Is a Ming dynasty ceramic vase worth millions or it‚Äôs just some clay? Is a receipt of a digital drawing the original? Is rarity worth anything? A 14 century tapestry of unicorn hunt important to the world? What‚Äôs value of anything if not the buyer‚Äôs decision to pay? Why is anything worth anything? 

It‚Äôll keep on getting discussed and argued decades from now, but in the end it‚Äôs all what the buyer is willing to shell out, for a receipt, a house, a painting, a rare book or instrument, a website DNS, space and bandwidth on AWS, a VR plot of land, etc.",192,hxujorl,t3_sx5n50,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hxujorl/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Reddit_Comments,doxx_in_the_box,"But that‚Äôs the deed to a house.

If you record serial number of a laptop you purchased it doesn‚Äôt mean you own it. The receipt means you own it - but it doesn‚Äôt guarantee you‚Äôll ever see it again if it‚Äôs stolen. 

If something can‚Äôt be recovered because police are unable to track it down, how do you get that back? Usually some form of insurance will buy you another, or if one-of-a-kind you get cash payout. 

So yes, even physical items can follow these same ‚Äúflaws‚Äù. And all you‚Äôre really saying is that IF spending money on rare collectible NFT you think is worth the money, find an insurer and protect it. It‚Äôs that simple.

But blockchain holds the original transaction to show you‚Äôre the rightful owner and so it‚Äôs traceable forever and ever - unlike a laptop receipt which can be lost and it‚Äôs up to the retailer to keep a digital record. 

And as all things, technology improves over time. Your issue is you‚Äôre so caught up in ‚Äúuseless JPEG sold for millions‚Äù you‚Äôre missing the bigger picture, exactly like corporations want. They don‚Äôt want widespread adoption of decentralized databases and ledgers, they want to control and profit off every single thing.",203,hxugawq,t1_hxudhxh,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hxugawq/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0
Reddit_Comments,CouchRadish,"Blockchain transactions are all technically ‚Äúequal‚Äù in the sense that without a governing figure (like intermediary sites like OpenSea) to dictate which are trades, purchases, and sells, all transactions are just recorded on the blockchain at the same level as each other.

The actual data each node can hold is pretty small (not enough to store photos which is why most NFTs are just hyperlinks to an image stored on a separate server) but programs, also known as ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù can be stored and executed on the blockchain. These programs can also be malicious phishing programs that transfer the contents of one‚Äôs wallet to another wallet. And since you can‚Äôt **remove** items that are in your wallet or on the blockchain, the only way you can truly remove it is by paying money to send it to another wallet. Middle managers let you hide the item from your page, but it‚Äôs still there in your wallet.

And without places like OpenSea saying this is a phishing scam, the blockchain itself records and views stealing the exact same as buying and selling.",179,hxuf5wt,t1_hxqeval,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hxuf5wt/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Because if you steel the deed to my house I can call the police and report it as stolen and they can verify that It was in fact not yours and then I can get it back.

Reddit_Comments,Tenac1ousP,"There is an exploit in OpenSea‚Äôs system that allowed people to make fake contracts for the buying and selling of a token.

I never want to victim blame but accepting half filled in documentation for the sale of ANYTHING is stupid. It‚Äôs a bummer people found this scam buttttttt it‚Äôs also kind of on the people not doing their do diligence. Most people have such a lose understanding of NFTs they just buy in to make a quick flip and end up getting scammed or losing profit because, well, it‚Äôs a weird market. 

I get people not liking NFTs. They are 100% a luxury purchase and most are just .jpegs you lose eth on.

Reddit_Comments,thagthebarbarian,"Let's take the idea to a more extreme case with the idea of nft art then. 

Let's say there's a nft validated original picture of a monkey... A bunch of people make copies of it whatever... Banksy buys the original (validated through the nft Blockchain) and draws a big dick on it. 

The actual piece of art has a banksy dick on it... That's the actual art and now all anyone else has is a poster of what it looked like before just like the Mona Lisa poster on my wall. 

That original is now a banksy and worth way more because there's a dick on it and your digital poster is still just a poster.

Yes I am a software developer lol, thank you for being condescending. 
Blockchain dev is faster for asset transfers because that's what the system is inherently designed for. You don't have to recreate the coding logic. 


You can think of blockchain as tcp/ip and I do understand that too lol. I'm saying it can be the underlying protocol (call it a read only db, it's really not. It has smart contracts aka code on there, it's more like a read only cloud computing network) of many things we do. It's absolutely a protocol not just a read only db as it does much more through smart contracts. 


NFT ownership is in the wallet yeah, I own an NFT and I use it in a game. It's mine, my keys my wallet. I then can sell it to another guy and he gets it in his wallet.


Layer 2 scaling brings cost down. If you actually care look into immutable x, once you get your money on it's free trading. 

That's the gist. We've both made up our minds but don't be so condescending about it saying idk what I'm talking about.

NFTs give you nothing of value related to the art. It's a receipt of the art, which is a best lip-service.

Reddit_Comments,anlskjdfiajelf,"Digital ownership. From partial ownership in a songs or artists royalties from streaming, to owning and trading in game skins and collectibles. I wish my online trading card games were actually tradable. So many major ones, (see leagues card game and hearthstone) are their own standalone launcher's so they don't use steam lol. Meaning no steam marketplace. 


And besides steam marketplace takes a fairly big cut and I don't believe the game developers get anything out of that transaction? I may be wrong. Mostly tho steam marketplace doesn't let you pull out your money through a legitimate way. It's all 3rd party and I got scammed as a kid lol. 


In short I'm most excited for digital ownership of my in game cosmetics so we can recreate TF2 hat trading but on the blockchain lmfao. 

Why blockchain is because believe it or not so many blockchains are out there it is less development time to create this trading system. It's affordable as hell with layer 2 scaling. Lots of reasons I shouldn't ramble too hard. 


I just wanna sell my old shitty hearthstone cards cause the game sucks lol. And these in game dust systems suck. A garbage legendary is worth the same as a meta defining legendary and I just wanna meme for cheap, but it ain't cheap to meme in the current system. Free market would make shitty legendaries cheap so I can meme without feeling like I've crippled my account. 


So yeah. Card games and general skins in games. I'd love to be able to sell old cards, old skins, to either stay in that games ecosystem and buy new stuff, or just leave that game cause blizzard ruins everything üòÇ. To answer, why Blockchain, it is far less dev time and a completely interoperable system with any other blockchain stuff that comes out. It's a message protocol like tcp/ip we use daily - just no one cares aha. 

I think the blockchain is a useful interoperable way to send transactions, some of which should be NFTs of my in game items.",345,hxso4le,t1_hxsm9zg,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hxso4le/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Reddit_Comments,BangThatsWild,"I‚Ä¶quite literally just explained to you why you would not get a forged baseball card that you found in the attic past an authentication expert. 

I don‚Äôt claim to be a tech or mathematics expert, but I sometimes have to review digitally signed contracts and I‚Äôm aware of the existence of hashing algorithms and how blockchains function for validation and security purposes. It‚Äôs good for things like contracts and account authentication because, in the event of a questionable situation, there would be real proof of who did what and when from a digital standpoint. 

I suppose a really motivated NFT owner could go out of their way to prove they are the original and rightful owner of an image but how many times? I mean as it stands currently, anyone can screenshot and copy an image so if all a person wants is to have that image for their collection, it‚Äôs pretty easy to do. 

Why collect something completely intangible that can be copied that easily where the only way to verify that it was, in fact, yours is to take legal action against anyone who screenshots an image? That sounds exhausting. Stealing art is wrong but a person can‚Äôt fight the entire internet if the entire internet decides they want to screenshot the monkey pic and say it‚Äôs their monkey pic. 

In contrast, actual, tangible collectibles are difficult to replicate because they tend to be either:

A) one of a kind custom pieces where creating any sort of exact replica would require physically getting ahold of the physical item and painstakingly making a physical knockoff and hope the actual owner/artist/vendor/fans don‚Äôt notice. I‚Äôve seen some terrible knockoffs of work by rather obscure artists I like. It‚Äôs laughable how bad they are. 

OR  

B) mass produced things that have a finite number of items in existence so when a new one pops up on the market, enough information exists for seasoned collectors, authenticity experts, legitimate auction houses etc. to validate if it is real. Like a real life block chain. People who work in museums have been doing it for centuries. 

To each their own I suppose but at least the state quarter guy can still admire/organize his quarters when the wifi goes out and the server goes down or there‚Äôs a weeks long power outage because of ongoing issues with the energy infrastructure and now he has to salvage all his generator/backup battery power for other things.

Reddit_Comments,anlskjdfiajelf,"Bruh what are you talking about? He said they're worth 0 dollars and that's simply not true. 

It's like saying btc is worthless. Sure, you may well think that, but if I gave you a btc and asked for it back for free - no one would cough it up. They'd sell it for dollars if they don't believe in it, but the fact is it is not worth 0 dollars. 


If someone gave you a bored ape NFT, I think your opinion would quickly change that it's worth 0. Certainly you wouldn't give it for free, you'd sell it at market value or below market value to get out of their asap - but the fact is you cannot be more correct than the market. The market deems them x dollars and so they are, regardless if you personally think it's dumb. 


You can say they're dumb, and useless in all reality, but to say it's 0 dollars is verifiably false lol.

Reddit_Comments,odraencoded,"Look, crypto is 1 billion percent safe, okay? It's the safest way to transact money evur, you know? No man-in-the-middle attacks. No bank/government suddenly deciding your have 100 dollars less than you actually have. It's all impossible because crypto is tough as nails.

What happened is that the users are dumb. They fell into a scam. A phishing attack. And now that they send their stuff away there is literally no way to ever get it back or even to figure out whom they send it to. This is by design because it makes shit safer, okay?

Here's what you have to do in order to avoid getting your money stolen:

1. Don't fall in a scam, ever.

Just do that, okay? Just don't fall into scams. It's that simple. Don't click anything. Not anything suspicious, mind  you, don't fucking click ANY THING at all. If someone sends you a NFT with a smart contract and you click on it wrong, it can steal your money, so keep your hands off the mouse button, alright? Don't use exchanges. They can run away with your money. Absolutely don't buy coins that aren't bitcoin. Whoever made the coin can run away with your money. It's called a ""rug pull,"" by the way. Don't send money to people who promise to give you stuff. Get stuff first, then give the money later. If they don't accept to give you the goods first, just tell them they're a scammer. Don't join a bunch of other people who hold around 80% of the entire coin and go use some new crypto tech that's full of bugs as any new tech is and that's going to get exploited by a script kiddie to make everybody lose millions leading everybody to agree to do a hard fork and basically rollback ALL TRANSACTIONS EVER DONE in the span of the last months.

If you just avoid every possible way to lose all your money and treat your wallet with care as if it were a vial of nitroglycerin, it shouldn't be a problem.

And then eventually, everybody in the entire world will be using crypto to buy stuff like cheeseburgers and pay their rent, and you'll be a billionarie in that future watching the poors who were born too young to buy crypto early if you just hodl now. It's that easy.",389,hxqwnxe,t1_hxq95kk,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hxqwnxe/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Mysterious_Banana420,"Good questions. All solvable.

NFTs can force a % of a sale to go directly to the publisher of a game. They can bake resale into the asset transfer programmatically. That's very enticing for publishers to expand their sale footprint - there's a reason the used game market is a thing.

NFT game chain can be created on a marketplace by the publisher.

Download server solutions remains the same. They just have to host it somewhere, that's easy in the world of cloud. Hosting platforms like steam could even have an autopayment baked into the chain per download. This is not a difficult problem to solve.

You can buy on a marketplace. ERC 20 and ERC 721 protocols allow for this, there just needs to be a flashy user intuitive site to buy and sell. That's coming (GameStop).

You literally do not understand what you are talking about, otherwise you wouldn't be posting basic SVG files as proof that most images are hosted on chain. They aren't.

If we're talking Ethereum, which is where most of this is hosted, that is simply not true. Ethereum blocks are 80KB. Almost all nfts hosted on Ethereum point to a website. I don't think you understand how a Blockchain works at all. You're right, it isn't easy to do so. Because of space requirements. It would be impractical for all these programs and images to directly be hosted on a single database. Which is why it isn't. It's trivial to actually put an image on the Blockchain, it is just a type of database. It's just if that image is greater than the block size, your going to have to pay gas prices for many, many, many blocks.

Selling any artwork and making a fraction of a resale is not the same as making money by signing up more investors.  A ponzi/pyramid scheme relies on an ever growing investor base because that is its only value.  A digital asset doesn't require more investors to make money.

""Royalties are, fundamentally, a way for creators, innovators, intellectual property owners, or landowners to earn money from their assets. Royalties take the form of agreements or licenses that lay out the terms by which a third party can use assets that belong to someone else.""

Reddit_Comments,customotto,"These things I mentioned are all small aspects of what NFTs are capable of. 

Being able to create a piece of digital art, like a video game, and making money off of every resale is not a pyramid scheme.  Its more akin to royalties.

I fully admitted to being invested in GME.  I could go into the many, many reasons why, all of which have nothing to do with MOASS and everything to do with what they're doing as a burgeoning tech company, but I'll let you assume I bought into the ""hype"" and have no real legitimate reasons for feeling this way.

Sure many of these things are already doable.  Does that mean innovation stops?  NFTs are the next step forward and you can see that to be true when you look at all the largest companies in the world hiring blockchain developers en masse.  From E-sports to apparel to fund raising to authentication, NFTs are going to be the next step in digital ownership.",169,hwyxv2s,t1_hwywojk,/r/technews/comments/ss1iwd/nft_marketplace_halts_transactions_due_to_rampant/hwyxv2s/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,,,0
Reddit_Comments,eatnhappens,"They way most NFTs work are indeed stupid. The core concept of fungible and not fungible are simple and important, though. A dollar is a fungible paper token: if you put it in a bank then later go and get a dollar from that bank you would be really weirded out if they had to get you the exact paper dollar you had given them. Dollars are interchangeable, in general any given one of them has the same value as another.

Non fungible is the opposite, each is considered unique in value. 

Right now most NFTs do not really do anything, but that does not mean there can‚Äôt be NFTs in the future that do provide meaningful value. A physical equivalent that exposing digital NFTs try to mirror is, for example, works of Picasso: each one has some value but they are not necessarily exchangeable.",144,hwywe0y,t1_hwvk3yg,/r/technews/comments/ss1iwd/nft_marketplace_halts_transactions_due_to_rampant/hwywe0y/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,,,0

Reddit_Comments,jj4211,"The problem is that while you may desire that, the copyright holders explicitly don't. The reason you can't resell a steam game is not because of technology limitations of delegating ownership, it's because Steam's DRM implementation won't permit it, deliberately. Steam could \*easily\* allow you to resell your games to other steam accounts, they don't want to.  NFTs won't empower you to resell anything that you aren't allowed to resell today. The whole 'used copy' for creative works has long been considered a 'bug' by the sellers and going all-digital 'fixes' it by making DRM required. Even when a game is comprised by a box with a redemption code which is also a 'non-fungible' thing, once consumed the seller invalidates the code (again deliberately) once it transitions to being associated with an account.

To get a guarantee of being able to resell, you'd need government to intervene and force it to be required. Without that it won't happen. With government intervention, then it's a simple tweak to their DRM system to deactivate for one user when activating on another, no NFT required.

NFT can't ensure 'only current owner can access' without centralized DRM embedded in the work, and any DRM system that can function wouldn't require NFTs to work...",208,hwyhe7e,t1_hwyfut4,/r/technews/comments/ss1iwd/nft_marketplace_halts_transactions_due_to_rampant/hwyhe7e/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,,,0

Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Well estabilshed business (40+ people) operating in a big industry (ticketing) and having a product that doesn't require a single bit of blockchain knowledge (they have already sold millions of NFT tickets to non-crypto-savvy people).

Reddit_Comments,kyozu8,"The ticketing industry thrives on its opaque foundation and is one of the major problems. There are a few behemoths like TicketMaster/LiveNation that control the majority of the market. To be able to disrupt this industry it is important to target the foundation of its system and be able to reach the masses, not only from a consumer perspective but also from a ticketing business perspective.
  

  
There are many projects working on implementing NFT ticketing. Especially in the last few months every few weeks another project popped up, which in itself is already an endorsement of the use case. The use case is not new though, about 5-6 projects started in 2016/2017 but most have either pivoted or stopped altogether. While NFT ticketing does sound pretty straightforward there are currently various types of implementations or ideas:

* 
Protocol
* Platforms
* Marketplaces
* Ticketing company

The only type that is able to gain rapid market share and accelerate while expanding (the snowball effect) is the one project that aims to provide a ticketing protocol: GET Protocol.
  

  
For me, this is an important differentiator compared to any other NFT ticketing project. The mission at GET Protocol is to be the Open Data Standard for ticketing or in a simple analogy:

&gt;GET is building WordPress for ticketing companies.
  

GET Protocol offers a blockchain-based smart ticketing solution for everybody who needs to issue admission NFT tickets honestly and transparently, ending scalping and fraud!",241,i3gzzbj,t1_i3gz9xs,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/two4yx/why_we_really_need_cryptocurrencies/i3gzzbj/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,public,0

Reddit_Comments,AcademicMistake,"Turkey is pursuing colossal sentences of over 40,000 years for suspects allegedly connected to a fraudulent cryptocurrency exchange.  
  
A prosecutor seeks sentences of up to 40,564 years each for 21 individuals accused of operating Thodex, a now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange.

As reported by Demiroren via Bloomberg, the alleged founders and executives of Thodex are in the prosecutor's line of sight.  
  
The indictment, issued Thursday, names Faruk Fatih Ozer, the 28-year-old CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange who vanished a year ago.  
  
A notice was posted on the Thodex website in April 2021, informing users that the trading post would be closed for several days to deal with a ""sales"" process.  
  
The cryptocurrency exchange never reopened, and investors could not access their accounts or withdraw funds. Thodex claimed on social media that no one had been scammed or had lost their money.   
  
However, many accused the exchange of performing an exit scam. At the time, Thodex called the accusations ""baseless"" and no more than a ""smear campaign.""  
  
While reports, at the time, estimated losses in the billions of dollars, the indictment has revised this figure to closer to $24 million.  
  
Ozer, who was reportedly last spotted in the same month the cryptocurrency exchange closed while boarding a flight to Albania from Istanbul airport, has been issued an international arrest warrant. The CEO claimed he was meeting investors abroad.  
  
Interpol has published a Red Notice for Ozer. The Turkish national is wanted for ""establishing organizations for the purpose of committing crimes \[and\] aggravated fraud,"" according to the law enforcement agency.  
  
Ozer is still missing, despite assurances made last year that he would return to his home country to co-operate with local authorities.  
  
Cryptocurrency is a popular fiscal outlet for many members of the younger Turkish generation due to Turkey's economic problems and the volatile lira. The trend has concerned Turkish financial authorities for years, with clampdowns being discussed, but citizens continue to pursue potential crypto profits in stablecoins -- as well as fiat currencies, including the US dollar.  
  
Last month, two alleged operators of a rug pull non-fungible token (NFT) scam were arrested by US law enforcement.  
  
The two 20-year-old suspects have been charged for running Frosties, an NFT project which raised approximately $1.1 million before an exit scam allegedly took place, leaving investors out of pocket. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) has imposed fraud-related charges.",429,i3gqs2t,t3_twpu7g,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/twpu7g/turkey_seeks_40000year_sentences_for_alleged/i3gqs2t/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,public,0

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

They're there to meet new people, have fun, and spread the word about their business.

For as long as Bitcoin was the hottest topic in town, when it comes to cryptocurrency trading, blockchain technologies are standard fare.

Then further, a social media network called VASTCHAIN¬© has been developed to incorporate blockchain technology into social media.

Compared to other forms of social media, what are the advantages of VASTCHAIN¬©?

The decentralisation of the blockchain technology is what gives it a clear advantage. In the future, users will have access to a speedier, more user-friendly, decentralised, and less vulnerable system.

When compared to other social networks, VASTCHAIN¬© has a number of distinct advantages. In the first place, this platform is part of DeFI category, which is meant to allow it to be plugged into the financial system.

As a result, VASTCHAIN¬© created their own launch platform for other tokens to use when debuting their own tokens in the future. The identity of the token's owner provides investors with an easy way to gauge the token's legitimacy. With the help of the upvote system, VASTCHAIN¬© give the public and expert analysts to evaluate a token project.

VASTCHAIN¬© also seamlessly integrates the NFT mechanism into this platform to eliminate the fake NFT that now prevails on Twitter and Facebook.

Play-to-earn, or P2E, is a function that is unique to VASTCHAIN¬© and not offered on any other social media platform today. For the most part, the rest of these services are just for the objective of enhancing individual's accounts. Playing a game on VASTCHAIN¬© will make someone obtain an income. You can make money by playing video games.

The future of social media will be revolutionized by VASTCHAIN¬©.

VASTCHAIN¬© is now in the development phase and will expect investors to partner up and elevate the VASTCHAIN¬© name to compete with the existing leading social media.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Shiba Inu Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by cbelaski which won 3rd place in the Shiba Inu Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an ERC-20 token modeled after the king of meme coins Dogecoin. This token has evolved beyond meme status, focusing on decentralization with their own DEX ShibaSwap.    
&gt; 
&gt; ShibaSwap utilizes the 3 tokens in the ecosystem (SHIB, LEASH, and BONE) to facilitate transactions and provide rewards. ShibaSwap has gone all in on the theme, renaming staple terms to more dog centric names: stake is now bury and provide liquidity is now dig. This helps to immerse users into the ecosystem and provides a unique aspect to those involved.    
&gt; 
&gt; Shiba Inu also has an incubator dedicated to ""cultivating an enviromnet which encourages creativity and growth."" This incubator helps those in the community with their NFT aspirations and is a large part of their decentralization movement.  
&gt;   
&gt; SHIB also has a psychological advantage not many coins can replicate. This comes from the fact that their are 1 QUADRILLION coins in circulation. Having that many coins helps SHIB maintain it's low price and allows users to buy massive amounts of coins for a relatively small investment. While this doesn't really mean much in the grand scheme of things since market cap is what really matters, people are easily swayed by large numbers.  
&gt; 
&gt; Looking past the technicals, SHIB is a force to be reckoned with on the community front. Following Dogecoins footsteps, SHIB may have figured out the secret to quick growth and utilization: hype. It doesn't matter how good your product is if no one has heard of you. SHIB has gained a rabid following through the ShibArmy and taking just one look at their subreddit will show you that they have all drank the kool-aid. If they can keep this hype going, SHIB is a meme coin that will stick around for quite some time.  
&gt;   
&gt; Others will argue that these meme coins are a negative on the crypto space and only further the idea that this is all fake money, but it is actually the opposite. Hype leads to growing interest which leads to more users in the crypto world. Dogecoin paved the way for meme coins as an entry point for the average person, and Shiba Inu is just the next evolution of that idea. As more users flow into this space and add their fiat into the exchanges, the crypto world as a whole will continue to grow and head towards our ultimate goal of replacing the current financial system.

Reddit_Comments,Zander11010,"In my perspective
LRC &amp; ImmunableX- Due to both being heavily tied to GameStop NFT marketplace. If everything works out then they're gonna get awarded big.

Luna- I hope for the best of it's competition towards Bitcoin.

Basic Attention Token- Privacy browsing is rising. And most users that are using Brave are taking advantage of its crypto BAT functionality.

Aglorand- It's a 50/50 in my observation. I feel that it may just be cut down temporarily. Though if they return their API back up high expect it to blow up like a mofo.

Oasis Network, Polkadot, NEAR Protocol, Avalanche, 0x, KEEP Network and Stacks- I'm assuming since they're highly tied to a financial position I would feel safe to invest into them for a few months and see how it goes üëÄ.

Centrifuge- It's just a guess in my part. Fucking yoloing it.

Fantom Token- I BADLY wanted to invest into this token but unfortunately there's no other way to tied to it. There's not even an option of buying a wrapped form of it.

Axie Infinity- The only NFT gaming place I trust to set my money into for now. Hopefully it still continues to go strong.

Ape Token- I just think Doge and Shiba Inu is going to lag a bit this year. Just putting some in for the hell of it.

Neo Token- Yeah this may not invest but I just believe in the project. I just get the feeling when this token gets exposed more to US and Euro exchanges or markets out of the blue it'll skyrocket it's gains similarly like it did to Etherum Classic and Filetoken when it gotten listed in grayscale.

Note: IM NOT A FINANCIAL ADVISOR THIS IS JUST MY PERSPECTIVE. But each on everyone's own hope y'all projects do it's best this year!",292,i3gk3fb,t3_twnhra,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/twnhra/what_crypto_do_you_think_will_be_worth/i3gk3fb/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,public,0

This paragraph demonstrates a basic misunderstanding of NFTs.

1. An NFT does not make buying, selling, and trading an image more efficient because when you buy, sell, or trade an NFT, you are not buying, selling, or trading the image

2. An NFT does not protect against copyright infringement. It does not prevent the image from being copied. Furthermore, the creator of the NFT will get a share of the sale of the NFT whether or not they own the copyright of the image.",141,i3giep4,t3_twn0gu,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/twn0gu/rock_climbing_and_nfts_an_unlikely_marriage/i3giep4/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,public,0

Reddit_Comments,jcm2606,"Two main reasons:
1. Like most other ZK rollups, it's application-specific. ZK rollups don't yet support smart contracts in such an open way like the Ethereum mainnet and optimistic rollups (Arbitrum &amp; Optimism). Where anybody could launch their own dapps on the Ethereum mainnet or the two optimistic rollups I listed, that's not the case with Loopring. Because Loopring is an application-specific ZK rollup, it is *just* hosting the Loopring exchange, the Loopring payments platform, and potentially a Loopring NFT marketplace. This not only stifles competition within the Loopring ecosystem (where with Arbitrum/Optimism you have multiple dapps to choose from), but it also limits what the Loopring ecosystem is capable of. Having said that, there *is* work being done to make not just Loopring but *all* ZK rollups be able to support smart contracts, *but*...
2. Loopring is not the only ZK rollup working towards zkEVM support, and it's already fallen behind. Alongside Loopring there's also StarkWare working on their StarkNet zkEVM rollup, and Matter Labs are working on their zkSync v2 zkEVM rollup, both of which are already functional right now, albeit in a limited capacity. Plus, Polygon has not one, but *two* zkEVM rollups in the works: Polygon Zero (fast and lightweight zkEVM rollup) and Polygon Miden (secure and transparent zkEVM rollup).

Don't get me wrong, Loopring is still a damn good project, and there's some innovative research coming out of its development team, but LRC shills really like to portray it as **the** Ethereum L2 with no other competition, when that cannot be farther from the truth. There *is* competition, you just don't hear about it because they're non-profit utility-first projects without a token to shill.",276,i3ghp16,t1_i3gdbig,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/twhe35/loopring_is_running_rings_around_the_competition/i3ghp16/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,public,0

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

If they want to make it easier for crypto start ups and entrepreneurs to move here and for people to use defi then that would be great but if they want to have a centralized cryptocurrency and highly regulate the industry it would be a disaster.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Reddit_Comments,SomeAncap2020,"&gt;PoS has no recorded 51% attacks in 10 years, PoW has several. PoS can also secure many chains in parallel, PoW can only effectively secure a few chains (one really).

Proof of work also represents a far larger portion of total market cap, and PoS has only been widely implemented as of recently (despite it being first theorized in 2012). And even then, most of the largest PoS chains as of right now are centralized shitcoins and/or dependent on NFT hype, so it's still hard to get a good understanding of how it can *actually* fare against attacks. Especially considering the fact that most criticisms of PoS also assume a large time frame. I find it very odd that you're trying to pretend that PoS is anywhere near as battle-tested.

And all of the attacks of PoW were on small &amp; weak chains, it is an inherently unavoidable problem to secure an underdeveloped decentralized network against powerful actors. PoS does not fix this.

You're also neglecting the fact that a 51% attack can be recovered from and dynamically countered-against in PoW, not the case in PoS. If an entity can secure 51% of the stake, then you're permanently fucked.

&gt;PoS can process higher TPS than PoW because miners arent so worried about cost of stale blocks.

Stale blocks have literally nothing to do with TPS. TPS is not a part of the debate between PoW and PoS, rather it's a matter of decentralization. Yeah, you could have a centralized shitcoin like Solana handling thousands of TPS, or require borderline supercomputers to run a node such as in Ethereum for hundreds, but that inherently increases centralization. PoS &amp; PoW are both consensus mechanisms, and have nothing to do with throughput. PoW coins have no problem with high TPS, look at BSV (a centralized scamcoin) or ETH.

&gt; PoW chains have few block creators, PoS chains have many block creators.

What? Be more specific, I don't understand what point you're trying to get across here. If anything, PoS leads to far more centralization.

&gt;PoS uses less energy than PoW.

Okay, so now tell me why this is actually a problem and not an overblown and falsely represented non-issue made for smearing purposes. Plus, there are better PoW schemes such as RandomX which increase decentralization and revive the notion of one-cpu-one-vote (as opposed to more-ASICS-more-exponentially-higher-votes), removes barriers to entry, and only consumes a small fraction of power compared to the already over-exaggerated ASICs.

This is also part of the reason why PoW is far better, it relies on real-world backing and not self-referential/circular ""security"". It also requires continual investment to validate, creates a fair distribution system, and prevents costless simulation.

&gt;Im amazed at how many people on this sub throw accusations, but have little backup for their claims.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Shiba Inu Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by cbelaski which won 3rd place in the Shiba Inu Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Shiba Inu (SHIB) is an ERC-20 token modeled after the king of meme coins Dogecoin. This token has evolved beyond meme status, focusing on decentralization with their own DEX ShibaSwap.    
&gt; 
&gt; ShibaSwap utilizes the 3 tokens in the ecosystem (SHIB, LEASH, and BONE) to facilitate transactions and provide rewards. ShibaSwap has gone all in on the theme, renaming staple terms to more dog centric names: stake is now bury and provide liquidity is now dig. This helps to immerse users into the ecosystem and provides a unique aspect to those involved.    
&gt; 
&gt; Shiba Inu also has an incubator dedicated to ""cultivating an enviromnet which encourages creativity and growth."" This incubator helps those in the community with their NFT aspirations and is a large part of their decentralization movement.  
&gt;   
&gt; SHIB also has a psychological advantage not many coins can replicate. This comes from the fact that their are 1 QUADRILLION coins in circulation. Having that many coins helps SHIB maintain it's low price and allows users to buy massive amounts of coins for a relatively small investment. While this doesn't really mean much in the grand scheme of things since market cap is what really matters, people are easily swayed by large numbers.  
&gt; 
&gt; Looking past the technicals, SHIB is a force to be reckoned with on the community front. Following Dogecoins footsteps, SHIB may have figured out the secret to quick growth and utilization: hype. It doesn't matter how good your product is if no one has heard of you. SHIB has gained a rabid following through the ShibArmy and taking just one look at their subreddit will show you that they have all drank the kool-aid. If they can keep this hype going, SHIB is a meme coin that will stick around for quite some time.  
&gt;   
&gt; Others will argue that these meme coins are a negative on the crypto space and only further the idea that this is all fake money, but it is actually the opposite. Hype leads to growing interest which leads to more users in the crypto world. Dogecoin paved the way for meme coins as an entry point for the average person, and Shiba Inu is just the next evolution of that idea. As more users flow into this space and add their fiat into the exchanges, the crypto world as a whole will continue to grow and head towards our ultimate goal of replacing the current financial system.

Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,ambermage,"&gt;Is the scary, Orwellian part. As cryptocurrencies become commonplace, not only will government seek to try and highly regulate (and tax) all sources of personal income, but they will also insist that everything from health records to insurance documents to your passport and drivers license, etc moves to Blockchain NFTs. For government, it's all about control and compliance.

Honestly, this is pretty dumb.

I'm going to be blunt with you.

* Does the ""government"" have access to you current digital currency holdings and spending?

Yes, they just send the bank an official letter saying, ""Give it to us.""

&amp;#x200B;

* Does the ""government"" have access to you National Heath Insurance records?

Yes, they cover the payments and thus, have the records already.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by idevcg which won 1st place in the ALGO Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; - Algorand's Smart Contracts uses the AVM rather than the EVM, which is by far more common (the only chain that uses the AVM is Algorand), and therefore there is a lot more support for developers on EVM compatible chains. Furthermore, applications built on top of EVM compatible chains can easily be forked into other EVM compatible chains, while everything has to be built from scratch on Algorand.
&gt; 
&gt; - One huge limitation Algorand currently has (although it is planned that this limitation will be removed in the near future, it has not happened yet) is that each individual wallet address can only create 1000 unique NFTs and 10 smart contracts. This makes it extremely inconvenient for large NFT collections and especially Play To Earn Gaming.
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand's native programming language, TEAL, is a relatively low-level language, which means it is hard to program in and understand for many programmers who are used to high-level programming languages. There were also huge limitations with TEAL3 like not being able to back branch, which significantly limited what developers can do. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Currently, Algorand's DeFi TVL is [not even top 40](https://defillama.com/chains) of L1 and L2 chains. There is only a  single working DEX on Algorand, which went down for 2 weeks early January do to an exploit.
&gt; 
&gt; - Some ASAs (the Algorand equivalent to ERC20 tokens) have Freeze and Clawback, which essentially allows the token creator to freeze people's funds or even take them away at their discretion. This adds a huge layer of risk of bad actors being able to steal funds by taking control of the original ASA address, and is completely antithetical to the whole decentralization aspect of blockchains. Why use a blockchain if you want a centralized actor to control everything like with the banks we have today?
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand lags behind most other L1 chains in terms of Marketing. It is virtually unknown outside of Reddit. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand promised 46,000 TPS by the end of 2021, as well as hinted at announcements of CBDCs also in 2021, neither of which happened.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,meepmurp-,"the article says, 
‚ÄúRussia‚Äôs expanded invasion of Ukraine last month inspired support across the globe, from dozens of other nations to scores of anonymous crypto traders.

Along with conventional military aid, Ukraine has received more than $50 million in crypto donations since the war started, according to research from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic. The majority of the donations stem from a tweet by the Ukrainian government asking for donations of Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, and Polkadot.  The Ukrainian government has since expanded the number of cryptocurrencies it is accepting for donations to include Dogecoin, TRON, Solana, and NFTs.

As the human costs of the war become clearer, with deaths quickly mounting and Ukrainian refugees fleeing to safety en masse, empathy and a desire to help is running strong across the world. For crypto investors, the war offers a first-of-its-kind opportunity to help in a material way. With its banking system under threat by the Russian attack, cryptocurrency offers a decentralized way to funnel financial support to the Ukrainian government, experts say.‚Äù",169,i3d0lap,t1_i3cydv8,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tw3jat/tried_it_out_and_its_pretty_easy_to_do/i3d0lap/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,public,0

Reddit_Comments,randomFrenchDeadbeat,"Switching to POS is a major risk, both to the decentralisation aspect and the possibilitie something just goes wrong.

Dont forget miners are/were a big part of the system. They got eth from mining, which they would hold or exchange for NFTs, other tokens or cash out... in any case it means they were creating volume and transactions. Going POS forces them out. It does not mean they will stop mining (well, except those who are using asics); they will turn to other cryptos. The direct volume they generate in ETH and indirect as everything else they do is going away, on another chain.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Bepro same. XHV realy? what target level do you expect for XHV? 

Osmosis might change the entire cosmos ecosystem:

in the near future though, like 1-2 years, I can see Osmosis becoming more than just a dex, but also having more advanced features. Superfluid staking is a great example of this and is a game changer.

Imagine if there were synthetics, derivatives, leveraged trading, borrowing/lending, etc. So many financial instruments out there. Staking lotteries have been done on other chains - can definitely do it here. P2E game(s). NFTs are coming (in case you didn't see the sneaky Keplr update).

For me personally, once the official BTC and ETH bridges are decided on, I can see the roof getting blown off this thing. Nomic Bridge (BTC) is currently in stakenet, so pretty close.

In return you get a NFT that represent when your parking ends. Unused funds will be sent back. Through the data on the blockchain they can match wether a license plate parked illegally or not. A person can then check said car personally and write a ticket if necesarry.  Parkingspots can be assigned a NFT too which could be traded(might want to make it subscription based).

The vast majority of people buying crypto are doing so because they want to get rich, not because there‚Äôs any use for it.

Various people are trying to cash out on the current zeitgeist, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not just digital beanie babies. Plenty of industry people correctly recognise it as a greater fool scam: https://lukeplant.me.uk/blog/posts/the-technological-case-against-bitcoin-and-blockchain/

Reddit_Comments,StarBlaze,"The way I see it - and I'll probably get a lot of flak here for it - there's no way to really do anything that's not in some way centralized *except* cryptocurrencies. You can make a pipelined system, but even if you took an imaginary system as such, there would inevitably be a handful of nodes or sectors within such a system that a significant portion of the remaining system and/or subsystems rely on that would inevitably ""centralize"" it anyway.

That's natural progression for a system. Cryptocurrencies aren't really any different - those with more of it have greater influence over its exchange rates - but since the only thing cryptocurrencies do is exist to be exchanged, centralization isn't as much an issue for them. Anything else that has a form or function outside of simple exchange would be more susceptible to the vulnerabilities of centralization. Take Steam for example. If Steam were to go down before offline mode was implemented, then you'd be unable to play your games on the platform while the service was down. Further, if Steam were to shut down permanently without any compensation or means to play those games DRM-free, you'd lose all those games and all the money you spent on them.

I think the closest we'll get to decentralization is NFTs in general. While they'll still be centralized in some form or another, if they're developed to the point that they can be sent cross-chain (i.e. bridged from an ETH-based chain to another blockchain), then even if one chain goes down, the NFTs themselves (which hold the contracts and such) could theoretically be ported to another chain and business would continue as normal with little to no disruption. Thus NFTs would be the decentralized system using centralized subsystems to function, but exist independently of said centralized systems. They still need the centralization to function though, meaning my initial assertion would still be true - the only things that can be truly decentralized are cryptocurrencies, and even those suffer from some form of loose centralization when one or more individuals hold enough of the currency to be able to influence its price significantly.

Maybe I am wrong and I'm just dumb enough to not see past the opaque glass of my own limited intelligence, but those are my thoughts on centralization and the inherent - and unavoidable - dangers of it.",395,i3bpy0d,t3_tvvn19,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tvvn19/alchemy_a_looming_threat_to_crypto/i3bpy0d/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,public,0

Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.

Offshit is multi-chain composable, Monero isn't. Aztec has the room for integrations with DeFi apps, Monero is yet to.

&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Reddit_Comments,Kyler_116,"Yeah I do watch Asmon's streams sometimes. I agree with his takes on NFTs. I like the tech, but not when it's with JPG images, it just doesn't make sense to me, it's pointless. All I'll say is that many crypto projects/currencies will have some impactful use cases and the crypto space as a whole does get a bad wrap for being scammy, shady and often viewed as imaginary speculative money. I won't go as far to say that it will replace fiat right now, as that's speculative. There's definitely some scammy tokens out there which doesn't help the image, which makes the barrier to entry kind of intimidating for the broad audience, especially if it's viewed as a cult. Asmon's views on crypto is a very common one and I'm not sure if he's memeing for the content since he's supported crypto in the past.

Let's be realistic, from Asmon's POV, doing his crusade on r/place with this stuff is great content, and it is. It's obvious, I can't blame him for doing that, he's actually very smart. Despite the fact you might think it's messed up, toxic or justified. He might even just have an exaggerated sensationalist streamer character/view facade just for the content and stuff, which is normal. At the end of the day, although many view it as effective advertising, it's just pixels of images...Unironically, just like NFTs. No need to get so hurt by it, it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. But to be fair, his followers doing any he commands at a seconds notice to ""yeet and deleet em"" on r/place is also kind of a cult activity in of itself.

Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#ATOM Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Shippior which won 2nd place in the ATOM Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Strictly speaking, [Cosmos](https://v1.cosmos.network/intro) (ticker = ATOM) is a decentralized network of independent parallel Proof-of-Stake blockchains, each powered by BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint consensus. It is seen as a network of blockchains that can scale and communicate with each other. Together with Polkadot it is seen as one of the first Generation 3 blockchains.
&gt; 
&gt; The Cosmos hub is supposed to be the center of the Cosmos network and it allows the other blockchains that connect to it to use its security. Therefore other chains can focus on things they do best. This has spawned other chains focusing on privacy (Secret Network), NFTs (Stargaze) or memecoins (Chihuahua Chain).
&gt; 
&gt; Cosmos operates through the [IBC] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYuTYykRhH4) (Inter-Blockchain Communication) Protocol. Blockchains that adopt this protocol are easy to link within the network and can then communicate with each other. This allows new blockchains to be easily integrated with the network and be adopted by new users. A good example of this is the rapid growing DEX [Osmosis](app.osmosis.zone). New tokens are integrated rapidly due to being integrated rapidly and the DEX allows people to start getting the tokens quickly after launch, in addition to the many [airdops](www.reddit.com/r/cosmosairdrops) that are currently happening.
&gt; 
&gt; Cosmos has fully functioning on-chain governance. Every proposal has go through voting. In voting a validator votes for all its delegators. A delegator however always has the opportunity to overwrite the vote of their validator by voting on a proposal themselves.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,iamjide91,"Am not an economist either but I know one thing, no investment, zero chance of having a fruitful financial future.

Things will not get better, that's a fact.

I have picked cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation because it's one of the easiest to access and one with maximum potential while having to risk a little to nothing at all I'm some cases if you know what you are doing. Thanks to the many assets and products (dapps) in the space as we speak.

Providing liquidity using [Tetu](http://app.tetu.io) and [Thorswap ](http://app.thorswap.finance) has been my savior. Especially using stablecoins. Yields from that is then invested into high volatility assets while keeping my base investment intact as I also continue to take profits from those to push up my stable coin investment.

I have also found staking NFTs like [DIA](http://diadata.org/arts) genesis NFTs credible as it presents me opportunity to earn yeilds of up to 2000% annually. And it's native token, in which I get the yields is also one of top data oracle projects, fairly undervalued, with potentials to grow. So I have no problem holding this long term either.

Again. The Blockchain has also present gaming fanatics opportunities to earn while doing what they know best, gaming. And you don't even have to be a fanatic or an addict, these games are easy, anyone can play them. Games like [Crypto Royale ](http://cryptoroyale.one) or [Mecha Morphing ](http://mechamorphing.com) makes this list IMO. With zero to little investments, this could ultimately turn into a side income or even completely replace your day job depending on the country you reside.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,No_Geologist_1826,"I believe we are reaching a tipping point in the financial system. Many individuals have claimed that a revolution has happened.   
Banks have been around ever since, they are the center of the financial system. Without banks, it would be extremely difficult to process payments and establish credit. It would be extremely tough to generate money. But, today, as I see it, cryptocurrencies/decentralized networks are widely employed in a variety of industries because people want borderless, trustless, transparency, and of course fast transactions. One good example of a blockchain that I‚Äôve known so far from cryptonists, bloggers, and members of the community, is the Telos Network. Telos is a mass adoption, open financial network managed by a community of innovators focused on real-world use cases and adoption.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.

Reddit_Comments,AsbestosDude,"1. Free crypto is a nice way to dabble into something without investing. See- Brave browser.
2. Defi is a way better opportunity to grow your store of value portfolio than staking on exchanges
3. You'll make more money investing deep into an ecosystem than just the native chain of the token. Say you want to invest 30% into DOT? Well why not invest 15% into DOT and 15% into some polkadot-based projects, crowd loans, etc. 
4. If you want to start trading, use a paper trading account first.
5. NFTs are a powerful technology, just don't get caught up by the insane valuations on monkey JPGs. There is much more going on with that technology.
6. New projects will often reward very early user interaction with an airdrop, there is a lot of easy to acquire rewards by simple interacting with new projects (typically defi related) (pls be careful with metamask)

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by idevcg which won 1st place in the ALGO Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; - Algorand's Smart Contracts uses the AVM rather than the EVM, which is by far more common (the only chain that uses the AVM is Algorand), and therefore there is a lot more support for developers on EVM compatible chains. Furthermore, applications built on top of EVM compatible chains can easily be forked into other EVM compatible chains, while everything has to be built from scratch on Algorand.
&gt; 
&gt; - One huge limitation Algorand currently has (although it is planned that this limitation will be removed in the near future, it has not happened yet) is that each individual wallet address can only create 1000 unique NFTs and 10 smart contracts. This makes it extremely inconvenient for large NFT collections and especially Play To Earn Gaming.
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand's native programming language, TEAL, is a relatively low-level language, which means it is hard to program in and understand for many programmers who are used to high-level programming languages. There were also huge limitations with TEAL3 like not being able to back branch, which significantly limited what developers can do. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Currently, Algorand's DeFi TVL is [not even top 40](https://defillama.com/chains) of L1 and L2 chains. There is only a  single working DEX on Algorand, which went down for 2 weeks early January do to an exploit.
&gt; 
&gt; - Some ASAs (the Algorand equivalent to ERC20 tokens) have Freeze and Clawback, which essentially allows the token creator to freeze people's funds or even take them away at their discretion. This adds a huge layer of risk of bad actors being able to steal funds by taking control of the original ASA address, and is completely antithetical to the whole decentralization aspect of blockchains. Why use a blockchain if you want a centralized actor to control everything like with the banks we have today?
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand lags behind most other L1 chains in terms of Marketing. It is virtually unknown outside of Reddit. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand promised 46,000 TPS by the end of 2021, as well as hinted at announcements of CBDCs also in 2021, neither of which happened.

Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Reddit_Comments,GameWorldShaper,"&gt; This is not how indie game development works. You build a working prototype and THEN you ask for funds to hire artists.

What you meant to say is that it is how you wish indie games worked, as there are multiple indie games like Stardew where the costs was carried by a third party.

With that said I am not opposed to making a proof of concept, or a porotype. It is just that these are not playable versions of the game. They are additions.  

As long as it is not expected for me to have a demo or an early build of the game yet.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You code, you make some barebones placeholder art

I am an artist, there is no concerns related to art for the project. It is the one side I can guarantee gets done no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Bullshit. The indie game market is huge. Most of these games started out being developed by just one person in their free time. 

Just because there are many small games doesn't mean there is a market for them. There is a GDC talk with the statistics, and multiple news sites cover it each year. Over 80% of the games on the app store where published by studios that shut down only a few months after publishing. The game isn't removed when the studio is shut down.

The huge indie market that you are talking about, the big indies, are just slightly above 4% of all indie games. What you are observing is survival bias, with most indie games not reaching the $250 line.

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting enough is that while all of these big indies did start with some kind of playable version, most of them had some kind of significant circumstance leading to that point. Some where modders as kids, others received help from family, a few got help from their schools and teachers, government funding.

Since the only thing I have is my artistic skill, it is what I have to work with. NFTs is a possible path for me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your project is way beyond the scope of what an indie game should be then.

I worked in depth on a Indie mobile game that took only a year, I plan on following the same structure. Of course I am aware it will take me longer, but in one year I will have something substantial; not necessarily my target but something.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,Zwiebel1,"&gt;
I plan on selling the first 250 NFTs at $96 each. That means I can only make $24000 max because that is 3X of my goal, to allow 3 years of development if I can, with $8000 being my minimum 1 year of development.

If you have absolutely nothing to show yet this is greedy beyond compare. This is not how indie game development works. You build a working prototype and THEN you ask for funds to hire artists.

A working prototype of a game can be produced by a single person in their free time next to a 40 hour job. You're trying to make sorrow excuses here for getting funded way before you should be funded.

&gt;understand what you are saying, but it is a catch 22. I need money to make a game, but I need a game to make money.

You don't need money to make a game. A working prototype build doesn't cost anything. You code, you make some barebones placeholder art, you put it up for public testing. You improve the concept based on feedback, build another prototype and THEN you start actually working in the stuff that does cost money to create.

&gt;There is no market for small term projects.

Bullshit. The indie game market is huge. Most of these games started out being developed by just one person in their free time. Some of the most successful indie games never even went beyond just one person working on it in their free time UNTIL they became successful and could enlarge scope.

&gt;Working with my free time alone I am only getting 2 hours a day now, that is 1/4 of what I need a day. Meaning a 1 year game would take 4 years at this rate, with no hope of ever adding multiplayer.

Your project is way beyond the scope of what an indie game should be then. You seem to lack a lot of experience of game development if you truly believe that creating a good game takes one year working full time minimum.

And asking for funds that big before showing a portfolio of finished games is asking for failure. Or just a plain old scam.

Buttcoin will forever say BTC isn't a store of value because of volatility. They will cling to that even if BTC hits 450K.

Same can be said about NFTs. To many they have 0 use case. However, I have one from a football game. It holds value to me. And it's use case was having a ticket that was much harder to forge. I also have access to it 24/7. It's use case was a ticket. 

It's a lot easier like the other guy was saying to just simply say crypto holds value because people will buy it. There will always be someone who doesn't veiw something the same.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Reddit_Comments,GameWorldShaper,"I have no intent of bailing, I am an artist, a creator. The money is not what interests me it is making games that I want to do. If I had the money, I would spend it on making games and other projects.

Of course I have seen enough of these projects to know that even people with good intentions are turned sour by money. That is why it will have fixed price .

I plan on selling the first 250 NFTs at $96 each. That means I can only make $24000 max because that is 3X of my goal, to allow 3 years of development if I can, with $8000 being my minimum 1 year of development.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is why I also urge everyone to not buy NFTs for games where the game isn't even playable yet.

I understand what you are saying, but it is a catch 22. I need money to make a game, but I need a game to make money.

Selling small games doesn't work, when they say most indies don't make even $250 it is not a lie. The hyper casual game I helped make didn't even get $50. There is no market for small term projects.

I work as an artist, I don't have the credit score to get a loan.

Working with my free time alone I am only getting 2 hours a day now, that is 1/4 of what I need a day. Meaning a 1 year game would take 4 years at this rate, with no hope of ever adding multiplayer.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by bthemonarch which won 2nd place in the Bitcoin Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Con: 
&gt; 
&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

Reddit_Comments,CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

&gt; BTC is the og and a great store of value, but it's stagnant and tech likes to innovate.
&gt; 
&gt; What I find interesting is much of the partnerships I see with major companies are not BTC, they are on various networks, most eth based, or some other smart contract platform.
&gt; 
&gt; My speculation is companies are releasing Q4 statements indicating nft markets and other crypto tech that is not BTC, and we are seeing money pulling out of BTC accordingly.
&gt; 
&gt; BTC still the top dog for sure, but that institutional money wants that next big thing as we all do. Case and point Facebook. They are trying to get out ahead of web3.0. this is a speculative market after all.
&gt; 
&gt; In the past, BTC was just the status quo of which to speculate. It's not really until today that new projects are mature enough to even begin to challenge it.
&gt; 
&gt; Eth as an example, seems like the logical move if you are a speculative investor, and projects built off of eth for that matter. It's been around long enough, has enough community, and offer more integration than BTC. Not saying BTC has no utility, but it's more a store of value.
&gt; 
&gt; A company wants to innovate, and with BTC there are limitations. ETH and other similar networks offer a framework for companies and investors to innovate via custom smart contracts.
&gt; 
&gt; Will it be a smashing success? No one knows but if we're talking about major adoption of Blockchain technology, the tech is going to evolve and the tech that supports for evolution the most will likely get the spotlight.
&gt; 
&gt; Tldr; smart contract based networks support innovation so perhaps BTC is crabbing because profits keep flowing into innovation.

SCOTUS will hear the case to reinstate Donald Trump and the skyrocket of the popular Trump NFT With his own Signature will happen!

It‚Äôs true, everything said about these coins and their skyrocket to $60.000 is true! 

2022 is the year of the TRUE AMERICAN PATRIOTS!

The worldwide scepticism made some people very rich and others only jealous for not using their chance. The huge meaning of the Trump NFT for the patriots means business opportunity for others.

Those who will have these Trump NFT will be treated differently than the others! This world is like that. THIS WILL BE THE SYMBOL OF AMERICA VERY SOON, AND NOW IS YOUR TIME TO GET IT! 

All you need to do is to TRUST THE PLAN!

They will be out of stock in the next upcoming weeks, get at least 7 NFT for you and your family and be a part of the AMERICAN HISTORY!!!!

Reddit_Comments,Alex_John007," Anyone can make money in NFT but you need to find a good project to invest in. Always look for one with a really good road map and with some additional rewards and bonus .  
Just look at the Bored Ape Club they recently launched own token and issued tokens worth millions to their holders.  
Also when you new into this NFT market its always good to start with some new projects with a really lower mint cost and have a growth plan.  
Also don't flip it just to make some small time profits. Usually the good projects have air drops and many other added benefits for initial holders.  
Also their value increases exponentially over time  
Check out this project I have just came across them couple of days back . Their mint is upcoming and is set to .1ETH and a solid plan . Have a look at this video, the guy is talking all about their 7 pillar structure

We live in an age where copying of information is lossless and does not incur any damages or take effort. Yet the majority of people inherently want to lock down their works even if their product is released totally free to the community to enjoy.

Reddit_Comments,Electron_Microscope,"&gt; I constantly see people who torrent talk about the ridiculous amount of storage used on their hard drives, (one time I saw some mention 4 terabytes of storage.)

You need space for what you want to download, want to keep, want to install.

4tb is probably well below average now for anyone torrenting more than on a casual basis.

Was laughing there as was imagining your shock when I point out that there are single torrents well above 4tb out there...and iirc that nft torrent was 17tb and is the current champion. :P

The tl;dr here would be that if you are watching one at a time standard def crap then you wont need a lot of space but if you are planning to play cyberpunk and other big games, watch quality 2160p/bluray, download masses of episodes, then even that beginner level 4tb will get filled really quickly.

They never claimed they made an entirely new client from scratch. It has always been a a modification of the official YouTube client, and they've never pretended otherwise.

They're profiting of the Vanced ""brand"", which is morally dubious, but it's certainly not as bad as if they sold (access to) the app itself.

I don't agree on NFTs either, I just don't think it's bad enough to think that the devs deserve to have their work shut down. It doesn't invalidate their work.",86,i20431z,t1_i203ak4,/r/Piracy/comments/tmyz3u/bringing_vanced_back/i20431z/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

Reddit_Comments,numerobis21,"&gt;is it that bad to try to make something of it (NFTs or anything)?

Yes it is, because:

\-that's the most stupid thing you could ever do when doing that sort of project, cause now you're legally trying to profit from someone else's work, and that the premium highway to court, and jail.

\-pirating is about the free propagation of knowledge, culture and entertainment.  
If you try to profit from it, you're just a greedy fuck and you just don't belong here

I know this is not the spirit of piracy.

Reddit_Comments,SpookyDoomCrab42,"The entire case is under NDA and neither Google or the vanced team will ever talk about what actually happened.

Google has a history of taking down services that use Google products to produce non-donation revenue and also piracy services that get too big and use Google products.

Reddit_Comments,Lickshaw,"It wasn't secret but it also wasn't really widespread news. Each time I've seen it mentioned it was through someone else's retweet or an article or a meme, so the majority of the people learned about it secondhand. It was quickly deleted because it wasn't received positively at all, so it became a schr√∂dinger's joke. You know when someone says something really rude and if someone else calls them out on it, they'll just try to laugh it off as a joke. The fact that they actually minted that NFT proves that the attempt was genuine and not a joke. And that's enough for the big corpos to think ""they tried to profit off of our work and if we won't stop them from doing it again, what will?"" Nintendo would've had their asses in a court before they could tweet that it was just a joke. But that is an extreme example. I do believe that the C&amp;D had the ""copyright infringment"" on it as the reasoning but I also believe that the only reason as to why google even bothered with that C&amp;D was their NFT attempt.

They were not under any NDA but still refused to give any reasoning behind the C&amp;D, logo infringement doesn't sound like something worth keeping a secret out of your own will, and they changed their mind on telling the reason only after people found out about that NFT stuff. Also they were super trigger happy with banning people and locking and deleting threads on their subreddit that mentioned their NFTs. Also also there are plenty apps with both similar logos and names on google's own app store, so that doesn't sound like something that bothers them. Also also also, they lied multiple times that their NFT attempt was just a joke when they did sell and mint it for real.

Let's go back to the real-estate example.  I ""sell"" you my house, by transferring my ""house NFT"" to you.

Then, after money is in hand, I say I did not in fact sell you my *house*, I only sold you an NFT that ""represents"" my house.

You paid for shit- and your only recourse is to go to small claims and plead that a judge recognizes a transfer of an NFT as a contract.  Because there's no enforcement mechanism for any of this, because we do not all in fact agree that an NFT is an ""asset.""

The only people who value NFTs are people who already value NFTs.  No one else- including the law- gives a shit.

Now, **could** that change?  Yeah sure.  It could.  Everyone on earth could have a simultaneous gas leak in their homes, and lose just enough braincells to all agree that NFTs are legally binding.

So what ends up happening in that world, is that an entire enforcement mechanism and all the bureaucracy behind it gets rebuilt to revolve around NFTs instead of paper contracts.

Reddit_Comments,jackinsomniac,"You know what the blockchain is? Basically it's a distributed/decentralized append-only database. Something that's only good for niche use-cases, like a transaction ledger. Normally the blockchain is what keeps track of people's crypto transactions.

An NFT is an entry on the blockchain with a little extra data. For artwork NFTs, this means a URL to an image on an external server somewhere. The image isn't stored on the blockchain, only the link to it is. So if the server goes down, that URL link points to nothing and will 404. This also means anyone with the link to that image can freely download it to their hard drive exactly like any other image on the internet. (It also means if a malicious actor gains control of the server, they can change that image to whatever they want, like a rug, to reference a rug pull.)

Sometimes, some of them actually grant the NFT buyer copyright rights to the art they bought, but this is *EXTREMELY* rare. The majority of them don't.

The best way to describe it is you go to an artwork auction, bid on something, and win. But then they wheel the art piece into the back room. Someone approaches you and hands you a receipt. You ask where the painting is going, and they tell you it's going to a privately-owned museum that's open to the public, for others to see &amp; enjoy. You ask if you now own the painting, and they say no, you own the NFT of the painting. If you finally asked, ""Well what did I just buy then?"" The answer is, ""The receipt.""",268,i0nnwml,t1_i0llzlu,/r/Piracy/comments/tdtfdg/nft_really_does_ruin_everything/i0nnwml/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Deep-Yoghurt,"Technically you can do it with renewables but that's more of an ""in theory"" when crypto mining collectively takes up more eneegy than many countries. And PoW is still the biggest by far. And PoS still takes shit tons of energy for something that's useless to society because it's costs more than easier options.

Even if you did somehow switch all mining over to excess renewable energies (which you couldn't in America at least because that would take lawmakers to stop rich people from doing whatever the fuck they want) then it's still extremely wasteful. Pow and PoS both take calculations even if one is way worse thsn the other. On top of that, blockchain tech by design has an extreme amount of redundancy. You're wasting an obscene amount of collective storage space (and thus energy to keep these storages updated, online, and available).

More to a previous point, America (and I would assume many other countries) would need a complete energy grid overhaul so if we did restrict cdypto bros to excess renewable power (which the US has already shown it won't) then the crypto bros will just raise a stink if we try to rework the grid to get that excess energy somewhere it can be used instead.

I'm all for wishfull thinking and new technologies but they have to be feasible and add something of value to society that outweighs its costs. NFTs have given us nothing of value so far but have taken shit loads of unclean energy. And crypto bros keep voming outta the wazoo to tell us we just ""don't understand"" and that ""NFTs theoretically have really cool uses"" without avtually taking the time to realize that there are networking protocols and applications that can decentralize things without wasting energy and storage space.",296,hyi3k1x,t1_hyhyfxv,/r/Piracy/comments/t0yjgb/say_no_to_drm_my_friend_you_dont_own_it/hyi3k1x/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Deep-Yoghurt,"(A) NFT tech is wasteful. Resources are scarce and climate catastrophe is incoming. No reason to speed it for no reason.
(B) NFT tech is harder to manage than direct USD transactions. I don't want ethereum for my nudes; it's volatile and there are gas costs (essentially a third party anyway even if it is less than the OnlyFans' take)
(C) I'm probably gonna have to use 3rd party software anyway because the average person doesn't know shit about minting NFTs or managing wallets. So that's another cost for a third party. On the other hand, if I'm gonna use third party software anyway, OnlyFans probably has a good UX.
(D) If I'm posting it to the blockchain, anyone can see it. So less people are going to bother buying it. It's **access** people want, not **ownership** when it comes to nudes. You can probably sell access instead with smart contracts but that takes a specialized software developer and more advanced users. That costs extra money. And if they screw up slightly, my content might be free or many other bad happenings.
(E) There's no undoes. If someone writes malware into a smart contract and sends it to me, I can lose everything. And if I actually send something to the wrong address, I again lose it even if there is no one using that address. Blockchain only has undoes when rich people lose money (see: ethereum v. ethereum classic)
(F) Similarly, there's no regulation. Onlyfans has customer support, ethereum doesn't (again, for the average person, that is). And if I lose access to my wallet, it's gone. No ""Forgot Password"".
(G) No technology is infallible. Yes, blockchain is more immutable than many other technologies, but even if that was a purely good attribute (see E and F as to why it's not good always), all layers of this cide are written by humans and nothing is perfect.
(H) There are better options. Anyone can start their own website to sell nudes. Way easier to find a web dev to post a simple server than to find a blockchain dev. Yes you would have other costs but minting NFTs, transferring NFTs, and converting to eth also have costs (not to mention all the third parties you'd need unless you're also a tech wiz).

In summary, any possible benefits of NFts could be solved by a more simpler decentralized protocol like Activity Pub where you pay the cost of hosting and allow for paid access through other domains.",409,hyhb16w,t1_hygpew8,/r/Piracy/comments/t0yjgb/say_no_to_drm_my_friend_you_dont_own_it/hyhb16w/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Flauros32,"I'm not pretending to be an expert, my first paragraph mentioned you should reply to the Twitter user since they are more knowledgeable on the subject than I. The point I was trying to make was, there is more to it than just jpegs. It's no skin off by back if they don't take off.

I didn't say anything about PoW getting more efficient, and with ethereum moving to PoS, more could follow. I was more so implying that their might be ways to use less energy to mint, but I'm no programmer.

Perhaps it was a bad comparison, I wasn't looking too deep into it, simply that electric cars went from being not really viable, to widespread use due to technology improving over time. Technology changes fast.

In a real world transaction I would assume terms would be discussed at the time of sale. Perhaps the royalties could be directly paid on the chain to the NFT holders. If you were dealing with dozens of contracts, you may be able to consolidate them easier on the chain. Just because something can be done already without a new solution, doesn't mean that it can't be replaced or coexist with a more efficient or easier solution. 

 I agree, the current state of NFTs is pretty bad, and is definitely a contributing factor to the hate NFTs get, and delaying or destroying the chances of widespread use.

Reddit_Comments,Deep-Yoghurt,"You clearly don't understand NFTs. I'd advise against using proof/arguments that you don't understand.

First, PoW doesn't ""get more efficient"". It is inefficient by design and necessity to create scarcity. PoS would get more efficient but still vastly resource inefficient and still greatly favoring the already rich.

Second, it's not a good comparison to electric cars other than how -- similarly to NFTs -- electric cars are a way of avoiding a real solution that would help everyone (financial regulation for NFTs and extensive public transportation for EVs) in exhange for ""cars, but new"".

Third, I talked about the music thing. And your solution could be done already with real contracts. NFTs boast about their immutable contracts but most contracts change over time as artists and companies/individuals change what they want and renegotiate. Contracts shouldn't be immutable or automatic. And all NFTs do is add a middle man.

Fourth, all of this ignores the fact that you can't ignore how NFTs are used **now** as welp as the resources they're wasting and the environmental impact that you can't take back.",176,hygit3f,t1_hyfd5qg,/r/Piracy/comments/t0yjgb/say_no_to_drm_my_friend_you_dont_own_it/hygit3f/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

So other than the streaming services: for onlyfans or twitch, there's no expectation of ownership, you're either paying for a service (I dont use onlyfans but im assuming you pay for private content and sometimes individualized content) or directly funding a personality you like.

Reddit_Comments,Flauros32,"My initial goal was only to inform people that NFTs aren't just confined to shitty jpegs, and I just used that thread as an example. Perhaps you could reply on twitter, since I feel it's beyond my scope to comment on some of this. The way I feel about NFTs or new technology in general, is it they can do it better or more efficient than their traditional counterparts, then they might be implemented. If people can't come up with ways to make it work, then it will fail. Only time will tell.

I will try to address a few things though. Take electric cars for example, they weren't efficient enough to use when first invented, but the technology has come a long way, and now countries are committing to switching to them over time. That's how I see new technology like NFTs, if people are actively developing, it hopefully should become more efficient over time.

As for NFT songs, I think it could be a good idea. An independent artist trying to raise funds for an album might make a single into NFTs where the holders get x% of royalties on that song. A bit contrary to what the Twitter user said, you could still post it on Apple, Spotify etc, but now they might rely less on getting paid by Apple and Spotify, and they might have already raised the funds for their album. If the song takes off, the NFT buyers are happy in the long run.

Of course if things like this were to be implemented, things would have to be a lot more streamlined and user friendly. Only time will tell.",273,hyfd5qg,t1_hye72fb,/r/Piracy/comments/t0yjgb/say_no_to_drm_my_friend_you_dont_own_it/hyfd5qg/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

Reddit_Comments,PiddlyD,"Right - but if a digital downloaded included an encrypted marker blockchain marker that  verified OWNERSHIP of that digital instance, along with the conferred right to transfer the ownership of that blockchain marker to a different entity...   


  
Now, an intangible digital asset is \*tangible\*. This is the other thing I don't think people understand about NFTs.   


Right now, if I am an artist and I create a physical object, a painting... a... let's use a BIRDHOUSE... if I create that object and sell it to you - it is YOURS. I'm still the artist, still the creator. I can make one just like it - and I can prevent you from duplicating it. I didn't sell you the rights to recreate and distribute my art - I sold you a piece of my art that you can then resell to someone else if you want.   


But if I create you a CGI birdhouse for your virtual property - you really own \*nothing\* except the legal right to put that CGI birdhouse on that property (within the limits of the license I grant you when you purchase the CGI birdhouse). While I can litigate if someone else takes copies of that CGI birdhouse and sells them - it is difficult and expensive to establish that I created it, that I have IP rights to it, and that you stole it - and nearly \*impossible\* to practically STOP either the individual by flooding the market with copies of my digital birdhouse, available for free - or for me to stop some company from reselling copies of my digital birdhouse for payment.   


NTFs change all that. It makes it so that the digital birdhouse I sell you cannot be copied and installed in your virtual playground - it can be SOLD to someone else so that they can install it in theirs, but the original purchaser has to virtually transfer everything about the digital birdhouse to the new owner. A company could buy it and resell it - but the same thing would apply. Someone else could make you a birdhouse, with an NTF, that is LIKE mine... but it would be verifiably not a PiddlyD Studios Birdhouse - and therefore, as authentic as a fake Rolex. Branding starts to have \*meaning\* with NTFs. Authenticity has \*meaning\* with NTFs.   


This is why NTFs are \*important\* for the development of a virtual digital economy.   


It may not be perfect - but it is the first step toward meaningful transfer of digital content. Until there is a secondary market for authentic ORIGINAL digital content - digital content WON'T be as tangible as REAL content.

pump and dump is probably the most common, with crypto influencers convincing their audience that some alt coin they already invested in will go to the moon, only to cash out as their audience drives up the price

but yeah, fundamentally a nft is just a ledger entry and a link to an external resource (that others can access &amp; has no guarantee to always be there).  the people buying them aren't even doing it because the nft has any inherent value to them, but because of its speculative value at some later date 

it adds no value, the valuation of them is entirely speculative, and the market they are trading on is a fully deregulated space full of open scams and grifts.

You can copy a thing, but without the encrypted NFT key, it'll just be a \*print\*... which is fine if you just want to LOOK at something.

Reddit_Comments,manpereira,"Jumping in a bit late, but I have considered the abolishment of digital copyright and am not entirely opposed to the idea.

Copyright for films and books works fine in the tactile analog world, but is an ill-fitted system for the digital world. When making economic arguments for copyright, as in implying that the abolishment of copyright would lead to less production due to less financial reward and lost cost and what not, I think that‚Äôs partially true, insofar as the digitization of media disrupts and mutates markets. But, to claim that it would suddenly destroy industries making billions of dollars is a claim I have yet to be convinced by.

To hone in on the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù aspect for abolishment, typically it‚Äôs because I think piracy is stupid easy. A great evidence to this is the absurd maximum penalty for pirating in the USA: 150k per file. Once one learns the basics of how the internet functions as a network of computers, simply going ‚Äúoh let me find a way to copy this file from that computer here‚Äù is a structurally fundamental process. The issue is that most people do NOT have the knowledge to copy files across the internet effectively (as well as a general trend of technological illiteracy and app-interface literacy).

Now, this is not to say that there cannot be efforts to restrict that purposely ‚Äúeasy‚Äù fundamental process. Exploitative and damaging material should be legislated against, and it is!, but not under copyright law. There must be another system put in place if one wishes to financially protect works of digital authorship and artistry. NFTs are a response to the unspoken-awareness that copyright doesn‚Äôt work ‚Äî people are trying to find a different way of making money from digitized creations. (Personally I think NFTs are also really stupid, but I get what people are reacting to here). Additionally, copyleft licenses which do not restrict copying, but vary according to other attempted restrictions are a definite improvement to standard copyright law, and are a prime example of the law following the medium, not the law chasing down and attempting to corner the medium.

TL;DR

I think we should abolish copyright because devising a new system that is inherently digital seems likely to be far more successful plan than the current bastardized attempts to make copyright work with digital media.",386,hu8ufz9,t1_hu86zgr,/r/Piracy/comments/sckbyd/copyright_a_form_of_modern_oppression_it_starts/hu8ufz9/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

Reddit_Comments,gotsreich,"They aren't literally the same thing but there's enough overlap that you can replace a lot of current DRM with NFTs. OP is just ignorant of what NFTs actually are. They're very confident though.

A NFT is a ""non-fungible token"" which just means that it's a token that has its own unique existence.For example, a dollar is fungible because every dollar is equivalent so you can replace one dollar with another. A land deed is non-fungible because one plot of land is not just like another.

For instance, you can buy a song from Amazon Music (not that you should). That lets you download or stream it to their app. Concretely, you're paying for them to add a database entry. A blockchain is at its heart just a database. So you could instead buy a NFT of the song. They'll query the blockchain to see if you own the appropriate NFT just like they do now with their internal database.

They don't have a reason to do this unless customers demand it though. Blockchains are bad databases but have the advantage that they're public.

Reddit_Comments,FaceDeer,"Yeah, systems like ENS do enforce uniqueness. It's just not something that's *inherent* in NFTs as a general class, because NFTs as a general class are hugely broad in their potential applications. Most uses I can think of would require uniqueness, though, so I imagine most would have that built into them as a matter of course.

The main trick with making NFTs inherently useful is enforcing the mechanism for how they translate into real-world effects. This is /r/piracy, I'm sure everyone here rightfully scoffs at the notion of DRM. A lot of people think NFTs for digital images are some kind of DRM, somehow, and are upset when people continue freely distributing the image that the NFT represents. The two situations where NFTs will really shine are ones where they can have some kind of *legal* enforcement, and the ones where they have some kind of *technical* enforcement.

Replacing paper vehicle titles would require the legal system to recognize the NFT as an authoritative means of asserting ownership over a vehicle, for example. If there's no legal recognition then I can sell you the NFT for my car, then report it as stolen when you drive away with it and you're the one who's in trouble (well, probably a judge would side with you in court if it was *that* blatant a rip-off, but you get the basic gist). More relevant to the current NFT craze, you could use the NFT as a way to license a copyright to whoever holds it. This is a field that's going to be slow to develop and probably quite messy.

The technically-enforced stuff is more interesting in the short term, but harder to pull off without ending up relying on some kind of centralized server. There could be an MMORPG, for example, that represents virtual ""land"" or in-game items as NFTs and allows them to be bought and sold. Or a digital trading card game like Magic the Gathering where the cards are NFTs, so there's limited numbers of each type out there in circulation. But ultimately it depends on the game servers recognizing those NFTs as an authority. It's a step in the right direction but there's still a higher authority that can take your NFT-represented ""property"" away from you without recompense.

The best cases are things like ENS where the NFT inherently enforces all of the uses that you might actually want to put it to, by its nature. That's pretty challenging to pull off in most use cases though.

Personally, I'm happy to see the whole spectrum of applications being worked on. As long as everyone who's buying or selling an NFT knows what that NFT actually represents and doesn't think it gives them more than what it actually does, it's fine.",458,hpvi4gy,t1_hpvdwf5,/r/Piracy/comments/rnlx13/yep_you_totally_own_that_movie_you_just_bought/hpvi4gy/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

Of an address. Not anything real. If you buy an NFT of a piece of art, you don't actually own that art (99% of the time) and can't do anything with it but sell that NFT. I haven't really seen where it becomes your artwork and you can license it and sue the creator for using it etc.

When people trade cryptocurrencies, it makes a transactional handshake that gets permanently hard coded into that crypto's Blockchain.

Because the transactions are traceable as they were recorded, but not assigned to an individual in any other way other than a login that only they know, allowing it to be anonymous. 

NFTs are awful for the environment because they get encoded *IN* a crypto's Blockchain, encouraging for more people to invest in them and in cryptos in general.

NFT and DRM are not mutually exclusive things or even really comparable things. NFT is not copyright it's more of a record (think smart contracts or a record stored on blockchain). People can transfer rights with the sale of an NFT but do not have to. That people think NFTs are copyrights and get mad when people screenshot an image is a flaw with their understanding of this concept.

&amp;#x200B;

Ubisoft could 100% remove the specific NFT that someone bought. But it would be much more convoluted than the current system.

&amp;#x200B;

These NFTs are public resalable items that are tied to wallets, not game accounts. Simply sending the NFT to a different wallet is all it would take for your cosmetic item to be used on a different account. Ubisoft could blacklist that specific NFT if they wanted to. But its a hell of a lot of extra steps. These items have a scarcity to them. For Ubisoft to ban one of these itmes affects the actual price of the rest of those cosmetics. They can always mint another (if their smart contract allows them to. This is another plus of blockchain. Its not about the company, its about the code written into a smart contract. That decides how these things function.) to replace that blacklisted NFT. But thats a giant waste of time and code.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure Ubisoft can be dicks and go through a shitload of extra effort to make that a feature (boy would that be EVEN more bad press for them). But Ubisoft is not the only company using blockchain tech. Many companies advertise this as a feature that non nft games can't compete with at the current moment. In fact, this is quite important to things like CCG games. If I buy Magic: The Gathering cards, I own those for life. If I buy a Hearthstone card pack, Blizzard can take away my account - and my investment - for things as simple as inactivity. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, CCG card games like Splinterland's and Gods Unchained fix a problem that was created by taking card games digital. Other game genres can and will use this as well of course.",313,hp1jyyl,t1_hp1grr3,/r/Piracy/comments/rj3fui/ubisoft_deletes_customers_account_with_paid_games/hp1jyyl/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

Reddit_Comments,look_who_it_isnt,"It's not the same. It's my understanding that the NFT isn't the artwork itself. It's the digital blip in the block chain that states so-and-so owns that artwork. So people can right click and save the *artwork* millions of times - they won't be able to ""steal"" the actual NFT. That still belongs only to the person who paid for it.

A better comparison to make is to art theft online. Artists post their artwork somewhere, and users will right click and save those pictures all day long - but the artwork itself still *belongs* to the artist (or whoever has bought the original and/or the rights to the image *from* the artist). The artist still has the sole right to profit off of the image and/or use it however and wherever they see fit.

In BOTH cases, people will end up doing whatever they like with the images. Most will just save them somewhere. Some will use them as wallpaper on their phone or PC. And a few assholes will print them on merchandise to sell illegally. It'll be on the artist/owner to find those folks and take legal action against them.

If content was food... Piracy would be eating a meal at a restaurant and not paying for it. Art theft and/or NFT right clicking would be photocopying the restaurant's menu. That's generally not going to hurt anybody *unless* you own a restaurant and try to pass off that menu as your own.

Reddit_Comments,mrdeworde,"I can kind of help a bit because I too like wall art but am not a rich person. The downside is that scanning high-quality art requires a scanner that can handle large formats and access to expensive art. For a decent looking print at 300dpi, you need at least 1728x2592 for a 24x36 poster - but over 4000 pixels to a side is better. At that minimum, it will look like ass up close - think pointilism where none is intended.

If you don't mind older stuff though:

* [https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en) \- this is a Dutch museum that has been making more and more of their collection available in high enough resolutions to do large format posters. They're even willing to honour requests for high resolution scans of objects in their collection - and they make those available as colour-corrected TIFFs.
* [https://www.audubon.org/birds-of-america](https://www.audubon.org/birds-of-america) The Audubon Society had a folio printed in the 1800s of beautiful paintings of birds. The book is ultra-rare because of its physical size (it's something crazy like 2 feet by 4 feet?) and the fact that the prints were had finished in each version. I've printed a number of these out at local printers in 16x20 and they look absolutely gorgeous without being tacky.
* The NFTBay might be able to oblige - some talented artists do NFTs for a quick buck, and the ""purchase"" often links to a very high-res version.

To answer your question, Disney uses the law to make it *illegal* to make copies of its things. Disney will spend 50 million on lawsuits protecting an unrealistic but unique silhouette, whereas that‚Äôs the price of the most expensive NFT - which is a singular unique string of code. 

That‚Äôs it. 

Someone used a $60,000 USD(or more) computer to make a picture that‚Äôs literally just a bunch of pictures *that already existed* turned into a 4 gigabyte collage that‚Äôs unique under the hood, but only just. What do you actually *get* when you purchase an NFT? A certificate declaring you the owner of a specific string of Latin alphabet and Arabic numerals. 

What happens when you screenshot an NFT? You now have a copy of the $54,000,000 pic, just no 4gb lump of random, useless characters that goes with it. 

There is most assuredly a way for a lawyer to argue that your screenshot is a breach of copyright or some bullshit, but that will just make sure every motherfucker on the planet sees it for free the next day.

it is different. not only because, as i already established, you don't actually sell the art itself, but physical artworks have an original. a copy is physically distinct from the original. the same simply does not and cannot apply to digital files. a digital original and a digital copy are 100% identical. you cannot create uniqueness in digital information and especially not by supplementing it with more digital information.

* Extremely well established music artists demanding like ¬£15 for ONE CD (looking at you TDCC)??? ~~Any film-~~ **ANY industry that says I'm only buying a ""license"" to view content and not the actual physical thing I bought?** Fuck you. Done. 
* Music available on youtube topic channels? A quick `youtube-dl -f140 -x &lt;url&gt;` and I've now got the song as m4a. Done. 
* Stupid fucking DRM implementations? Pirating is easier. 
* TV licensing? ppfffffffffttttttt
* Any sort of streaming service where what I want could disappear without notice because I dont have a physical copy or backed up copy on my collection? Done.
* NFTs? Fuck you and fuck everything about NFTs. Proud right clicker. (This server-space isn't going to fill itself right?)
* Research papers hidden behind a publisher? Fuck you. I'm going to the researchers themselves and almost all of the time, they'll give them for free and are often happy to do so. 

Stuff I dont pirate? 

* Steam games and some on itch. Its just easier. 
* Also audio books, I'd buy the CDs, rip them and then add to the collection. Also another reason to go out :-) 
* Open source efforts. Although yeah you don't have to pay for them, I always like donating a small bit to help.
* Bands I really like and want to support. Again I dont have to, most of them have youtube topic channels and I could easily just use youtube-dl if I'm having a hard time....

Reddit_Comments,logicalpsycho,"Having a validated creator makes something scarce. As long as the creator made a limited number of a thing, that thing has more value than something counterfeit - even if it's an exact copy.

Switching examples: let's say Nike starts doing NFT sneakers that you can wear in Fortnite. If someone clicks on your character, it shows that your shoes are part of a limited Nike release, with Nike as the confirmed creator. Some character standing next to you has the perfect counterfeit copy, but when people click on their character, the creator of the sneakers comes up as shit_lord69 or something like that.

In this example, the avatar with the official Nike sneakers has more clout in-game than the person with the counterfeit. The person with the counterfeit sneakers might get made fun of, or maybe Fortnite might implement a system where you can't even import an NFT from an unknown/unverified creator.

You personally might think NFTs are dumb as shit, and paying money for gaming skins is dumb as shit, but you can bet your bottom dollar there are plenty of kids that will pay $10 for the Nike shoes and wouldn't ever get caught wearing some counterfeit, unverified duplicates.

As food for thought, extending the example a little further: what if owning the Nike NFT gives you access to Nikeland in Fortnite, with exclusive access to a Drake concert in-game. What if it also gives you early buyer access to real-life physical Nike shoes in the future? These are the utilities that can be added on top of NFTs - they aren't just a JPG or voxel, the additional functionality built on top is literally limited only to the imagination of the community.",282,hk51c2p,t1_hk4r3kj,/r/Piracy/comments/qq6azg/you_wouldnt_download_a_jpeg/hk51c2p/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,,,0

If you‚Äôre buying a Ken Griffey card, you make sure it‚Äôs authenticated first, ie you know Upper Deck made it on X date, it‚Äôs one of 10k made, these three people had it before you, it sold at these prices, etc. 

Now make a digital trading card of Ken Griffey. The NFT can be confirmed as minted by Upper Deck, you can see who‚Äôs crypto wallets held the NFT before you, etc. 

The physical one you put in a case in your living room for people to see when they come over. The digital one you put on your social media profile for people to see when they are on your page(s).

There is a central point to the technology, and that is the place you bought it to begin with. That place can link the transaction to the NFT.

But what if that website goes down? What if it gets hacked? Then how would you be able to prove a NFT purchase?

The only information the blockchain holds (for most *common* cryptocurrency) is information about transactions, and information about the block mined. There is no *image* or *music* or ownership on the blockchain itself, only transactions. That's what it is.

Reddit_Comments,sapphirefragment,"Furry artists and the people who commission them almost universally understand that you're paying for an artist's **labor and time**, not property. Most artists have contracts stipulating that you have to pay more if you want to retain rights over the work, if they offer selling the rights at all. Artists want to reserve their rights to use the commissioned art as part of their own galleries, which helps with their own marketing, and commissioners are generally fine with this because they're getting what they want anyway. Therefore NFT art not only has all the stupid scam baggage associated with it, up to and including the insane ecological waste it causes, but it's also just utterly pointless for actual artists doing actual commission work _and_ their customers.

You don't need your fursona avatar to be an NFT to be proud of it and the way it represents you. It has nothing to do financialization at all. This is true of the rest of the freelance art industry too. The ""art trade"" that NFT replicates is riddled with fraud and money laundering too, and doesn't reflect the vast majority of artists at all.

Reddit_Comments,reifactor,"Owning an NFT just means your name is connected to it on an official public document. Other people can check the document to see if your name is connected to the thing. (and crypto means it's really hard to fake the document or your credentials)


Imagine Bob's Pizza sells an NFT certificate that entitled the owner to a free pizza (max 1 per week) if they show up to the pizza place.


 The owner of the NFT can show up, present their credentials, and the restaurant owner can check the public document to see if that person owns the NFT at the time. 


Everything checks out and the man gets his pizza. 


Another stranger shows up the next week and says they own the certificate. But their name is not connected with the certificate on the public document so they get laughed out of the restaurant.


The following week an additional stranger comes, claims the NFT, and asks for a pizza. Bob checks and it turns out that yes, that current person does own it now as the previous man has sold it to them. Bob gives them the pizza.


You ""own"" the slot on the official public document, the value of the slot depends on how other people treat it. Here I made the ""perks"" of owning obviously valuable, but in most cases it will be more subtle or actually just worthless.

Reddit_Comments,Degru,"It functions on the same system as crypto, but instead of currency it is a unique identifier associated with a particular digital file. 

Crypto has a Blockchain which is a distributed public record of all transactions that take place. NFTs use the same system but for unique identifiers associated with say, images or other files. So people can copy the file itself but only one person actually ""owns"" the content. 

It's a neat idea that gives digital art something of an analogue to ""owning"" the original painting, but in practice the system only really applies to those who believe in it because anyone can still download the file itself.",109,hk0jwzi,t1_hjzwr9n,/r/Piracy/comments/qq6azg/you_wouldnt_download_a_jpeg/hk0jwzi/,3,Piracy,t5_2qmox,,,0

Reddit_Comments,Zanion,"To get a painter requires finding/commissioning an artist of sufficient skill. You incur risk too, that it may not be well done and you would need to start over. Maybe the paints the forger uses aren't the same composition. The strokes themselves are essentially guaranteed to not be the same. There is also the temperature, environment, or the million other parameters that would make a replica painting non identical to some degree. All of this is expensive too of course, in both time and money. So the original, is always the original and cannot be exactly replicated and approximating a functionally identical copy is expensive.

Assume instead anyone can have an exact replica of that painting, created practically instantly, for free and at-will. These properties are importantly what separates digital art from physical art fundamentally. It's also what makes this explanation akin to comparing apples to oranges. I'm not convinced that explanation serves to aid understanding NFTs very well at all.

Nearest I can tell, NFTs serve as a glorified notary. So, maybe using them against physical assets like we use a paper deed for a house makes sense, even as a deed of ownership for art makes sense. Assuming there are proper real-world processes working in tandem with the tech and enforcing the mapping of physical assets to digital record. This makes sense because houses and physical artwork have well understood and enforceable ownership properties. Using NFTs as proof of ownership of digital art where the very concept of ownership isn't even clear or enforceable, doesn't make a lot of sense.

Maybe NFT tech could back some sort of digital licensing technology, not clear to me if that would be a meaningful improvement on existing licensing solutions. But it at least is a way that makes sense to apply ownership properties to digital assets.",302,hk07zje,t1_hjzyixt,/r/Piracy/comments/qq6azg/you_wouldnt_download_a_jpeg/hk07zje/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Kvellish,"Easiest way I can try to explain it (not exact, just to give an idea):

1. I make a link of steel and put my name on the inside.
2. You take that link, add your own, then stamp my name then your name. You tell me what you've done.
3. Your friend takes those two links, creates his own, then stamps my name then your name then his name in his. He tells us both what he has done.

Once this chain is 50 links long and 50 people have seen the changes (and I have been told about them 49 times now, you have 48), we all have a ledger of changes. This means every change is documented in each ledger.

Now say someone, I dunno, shifty wants to deceive us by adding some link. He wants to replace the 35th link, for whatever reason, with his name. First of all, every ledger would disagree with him. Every later link would also disagree with him. In this way, it is a great way of keeping track of really important things, such as things worth significant amounts of money. To deceive, he would have to figure out a way to modify all links after his AND make changes to everyone's ledger.

This is not a good thing for petty shit like a tweet or a picture of a hamburger because of the computational information required. Think of how many CPU cycles around the globe that would be dedicated to verifying the authenticity of a screenshot of a tweet. Those CPU cycles generate heat. On a single picture, that is not big deal. But every Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Etherium, and NFT transaction all generate heat; and the longer the chain (Bitcoin was created in like 2009 or something), the more CPU cycles are dedicated to maintaining both the chain and the ledgers. Mining coins is a bit different, but the entire blockchain technology is responsible for documented temperature increases in a lot of places.

Reddit_Comments,jason_abacabb,"&gt;You are greatly underestimating how manipulated the stock market is, you are describing its original intent, not what it has become

Portions of the stock market are running on pure speculation (Staring at TSLA)  and we are at a period in time where valuations are elevated.  That does not make it manipulated.  Don't conflate stuff like what happened with GME as the rest of the market.

&gt;Blockchain technologies are nothing to gloss over here, literally the biggest breakthrough in computer science since the 1980's. You seem to be stuck on this concept that crypto is just memes and virtual coins. Yes, I mentioned there are multiple Minecraft servers running on the blockchain, because like it or not Minecraft is the best selling game of all time.

If blockchain was such a grand breakthrough then it would be integrated with more by now.  there was a big push for it a few years ago when people were throwing money at anything with blockchain in the description and it went nowhere.  

The minecraft implementation is also not running a minecraft server, just ""tokenizing"" items on it to turn it into some NFT like idem tracking.  WTF is the point?

&gt;You a really underestimating what happened over the last year  
  
I was told this in 2017 when I was mining, lets just say it has worked out well for me.

I am fully aware of the inflating bubble; and good for you.  May your bags be light when it deflates.

&gt;Here I do somewhat agree, but centralized and privatized POS systems are not the blockchain we should be looking for. I You also need to realize I have been around a long while. These energy consumption concerns were the EXACT same with the early internet. Believe it or not they were saying the same thing about the stock markets power consumption in 2011, at a time when data centers were using over 2% of US energy consumption already. I dont see how complaints about power consumption make a lot of sense when the scene is clearly experimenting with various solutions. Meanwhile 40%+ of the US power grid is consumed by what now remind me? There are much greater ecological problems the government does nothing about or directly causes. Meanwhile people point to the smallest problem in the room.

I find the comparison between the entire internet a decade ago (hardly the early internet, I used to dial into the early internet in the 90's) and crypto now a bit silly.  

I am still yet to find a good use case for crypto.",433,hks249e,t1_hkrtlmh,/r/savedyouaclick/comments/qu3nk4/10_best_cryptocurrencies_redditors_are_buying/hks249e/,1,savedyouaclick,t5_323r3,,,0

And last year (February 2021) they announced this:

Reddit_Comments,MultiMarcus,"You are certainly correct in the sense that developers/publishers aren‚Äôt innocent when taking the Epic money, but in my mind it works like bribery. Both the briber and bribed are guilty. Not that I see a contract of exclusivity as bribery, but guilt wise they are similar. 

I don‚Äôt think we would excuse any other platform launching like it is the early 2000s when modern stores are of a higher standard. Uplay and Origin are terrible, but those are at least just a company‚Äôs attempt at creating their own launcher. They aren‚Äôt trying to play the role of main store for people. 

Steam definitely needs competition, but for me and many other PC gamers, it is specifically the exclusivity that we have problems with. That and NFTs. No one said they can‚Äôt make games cheaper, have better sales, give out free games, have better cuts, or make the browsing experience better than Steams. You can compete for customers in ways that benefit the customer like the things I mentioned or things that demonstrably hurt the customer, even if only a small amount, like for example having exclusive games. That doesn‚Äôt give you more games, but rather takes away games from another platform. 

It is odd to see you against Origin and Uplay when those are demonstrably better for developers and give the company 100% of the profit and then a sentence earlier support Epic for giving more profit to the company. Could you explain your reasoning there?

The extreme hate is certainly unjustifiable, but disliking Epic is more than possible and as much as free games are nice, I don‚Äôt think they need to do exclusivity. Make the store Steam level or better before you start pouring money into exclusivity deals. I am also quite economically stable, so I don‚Äôt care much for free games or better sales, but I understand why that would matter to a lot of people.",319,i2l42ot,t1_i2l0jyv,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/tr1rzy/epic_games_is_now_the_biggest_corporate_donor_to/i2l42ot/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

I mean the laziest but probably most efficient con is to mint an NFT, shuffle it through a few wallets at an ever increasing price, and then sell it at a ""discount"" to a mark.

You're out the cost to mint the NFT, and transaction costs between wallets (both ways, as you'll have to refill them for the next NTF), but as long as you sell your NFT above those costs you're making money. And some idiots will shell out enough to pay for your creation costs a dozen times or more over.

Reddit_Comments,GeekOnFleek97,"As someone who has watched this story unfold from January of 2021 I think the evidence is absolutely damning.

The SEC released a report showing that short sellers did not cover their massive short positions. The DD shows how they can be hidden using far out of the money married puts (which are visible to the general public) 

Check February 24th 2021 GME. $40 - $200 for what reason?

Check March 10th 2021 GME. $350 to $40 (it'll show up as like $170 on the chart) in 20 minutes. The news of which released before it happened. How?

Regardless if you believe in a short squeeze play or ""MOASS"" (Mother Of All Short Squeezes) (due to the huge short interest) Gamestop is reinventing itself as a technology company and I'm excited to watch what Ryan Cohen and his team of incredible people are about to achieve.

Reddit_Comments,WillDeletOneDay,"&gt;His treatment of talent is also well known to be horrendous

Worst I've seen recently is that he forces employees to use their vacation time and he was yelling at Luke for answering emails on his day off. I went searching for info on wtf you're talking about but I can't find anything. His employees have openly and casually mocked some of self-admitted control freak tendencies, but that's about it.

He specifically is not relocating his headquarters despite how insanely expensive it is to be in Vancouver because he doesn't want to force his employees and their families to relocate.

&gt;he thinks that employees should straight up he barred from using social media without their employers permission.

New employees have a probationary period where they can't appear on videos and aren't mentioned by name. You could argue that that is weird, but I don't exactly know *why* this is a rule.

&gt;He's also heavily invested in crypto and i believe even NFTs.

This right here is bull. He briefly considered starting a coin until he realized there was no legitimate use for one. and his stance on NFTs has been fluctuating a lot, but it generally seems like his stance is that they aren't inherently bad, but have a lot of potential for abuse.

&gt;He's come out against unions before on Twitter.

All I can find on Linus' stance on Unions is this:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpyiNOD-MOk
* https://twitter.com/linustech/status/1155899393620336640

I'm generally pro union, but I can agree with the statement that unions aren't a flawless thing with no problems. His example of a useless fucking teacher that is unfireable is something I also have personal experience with. Many teachers' unions protect tenured teachers while doing almost nothing to protect younger teachers. A bad union can definitely be worse than no union, but that doesn't mean unions shouldn't exist.

His Twitter stance against a YouTuber Union honestly just totally lacks any nuance. I see zero explanation for why he feels the way he does, but it's clear to me that he sees no benefit in a union in this very specific context. While unionization is generally good for workers, there are definitely some places where unions don't make any sense, the biggest example is police unions.

Overall it seems like he's not firmly on either side of the fence in regard to unions.",377,hx4xq4i,t1_hx4uisa,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/srzo17/developer_of_stress_testing_software_occt_posts_a/hx4xq4i/,14,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,,,0

It sounds like Second Life with cryptocurrency instead of real money. Except this will lead to people ""playing"" the game purely to earn money and where some players will grow so large they will turn into a real company with real job applications.

Reddit_Comments,FaceDeer,"DNS servers are not decentralized, even though the protocol itself is, and the administration of various TLDs is definitely not. Names are assigned by authoritative servers. Under ENS there's no authoritative server, you can administer your domain by issuing transactions through any Ethereum node.

[There are plenty of ways that DNS can be attacked](https://www.infoblox.com/dns-security-resource-center/dns-security-faq/what-are-dns-attacks/). [Major DNS outages happen](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/a-dns-outage-just-took-down-a-good-chunk-of-the-internet/) despite whatever decentralization is built into DNS' protocol. An ENS name can't go down without the entire Ethereum blockchain state being inaccessible and it is simply not susceptible to most of the forms of attack described here.

Nothing prevents you from overloading the host associated with the record, it has nothing to do with ENS. I'm not sure why you would think it was, this is like objecting to building a house with a steel frame instead of a wooden one because you can still shoot the homeowner when they answer the door.

Anyway, I'm not trying to ""sell"" you on ENS or convince you to use it. I'm presenting it as an example of a NFT-based system that serves a technical purpose. You asked if there were NFTs that served a technical purpose, here is one. I could mention more, but these discussions really don't feel particularly rewarding to put effort into.",208,hvct7mt,t1_hvcldkb,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sir6lv/rcryptocurrency_mod_profits_10k_by_selling/hvct7mt/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

Reddit_Comments,LordByronic,"The ape pictures are one of (if not *the*) most prominent NFTs right now, known as the Bored Ape Yacht Club.

If you think they look like somebody hit 'random' on a character creation screen or picrew and posted the result, it's because they essentially did.  The issue with minting/creating NFTs is that you have to have a unique piece of media attached to each spot on the ledger.  Hand-crafting a different piece of artwork, even something as simple as a JPEG, is out of the question - we're talking about thousands and *thousands* of JPEGs.

There's two ways to circumvent this.  The first is to have a backlog of media assets you can already use.  That's why you hear about a company like Konami ""selling Castlevania assets"" as NFTs.  They already have, all of the original sprites for the games, so they don't need to put any effort or resources into creating anything new.  That has the added benefit of brand recognition: don't you want to ""own"" the original sprite of Dracula?

The second way is to procedurally generate your images.  Let's say you're wanting to sell ten thousand NFTs - that means ten thousand spots on your ledger, or ten thousand spots in the imaginary line I mentioned earlier.  Each spot is assigned a numerical value, from 0000 to 9999, so we don't have any repeated numbers.  The number on that particular ledger is the actual NFT that you're selling, but you need the image to go along with it, because people like to feel that they've bought something tangible.  You have a basic template image - let's say a stick figure - and four variations: the stick figure's hat, the color of the background, the small object they're holding in their hand, and the border of the image.  You create ten different variations for each of them - ten different hats, ten different borders, etc - and assign each variation a number from 0 to 9.  Somebody buys the NFT for 4360, it means they get the image with the exact variations assigned to those numbers in those spots: hat #4, background #3, object #6, border #0.  The fact that it means that every NFT looks cheap, mass-produced, and ugly doesn't really matter - what matters is that each one is, technically speaking, completely unique from the rest.",401,hus6fp1,t1_hus29zd,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sfoenm/a_article_about_how_to_block_everyone_who_uses/hus6fp1/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

You can buy games as NFTs, and use the keys to unlock the games on both Xbox and PlayStation, instead of buying one for each system.

See https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html for more details from someone who did something similar to this. Relevant quote:

&gt; So as an experiment, I made an NFT that changes based on who is looking at it, since the web server that serves the image can choose to serve different images based on the IP or User Agent of the requester. For example, it looked¬†one way¬†on OpenSea,¬†another way¬†on Rarible, but when you buy it and view it from your crypto wallet, it will always display as a large üí© emoji. What you bid on isn‚Äôt what you get. There‚Äôs nothing unusual about this NFT, it‚Äôs how the NFT specifications are built.

Reddit_Comments,LordByronic,"Imagine I was selling spots in a line.  The line does not go anywhere, the line does not do anything, there is no benefit to being in the line.  For every spot in the line - let's say a hundred - I hang a picture next to it, associated with its spot in the line.

You buy the thirty-eighth spot in the line.  I give you a receipt saying that you are the only person that has the permission to stand in the thirty-eighth spot in the line, next to whatever picture I put there.  I also make a note in a public ledger that ClockworkDreamz owns that spot in the line.  If at any point you later sell your spot in line to somebody else, I update the ledger.  I don't cross out that you had owned it, I just add ""ClockworkDreamz sold the thirty-eighth spot to this person.""

You do *not* own the picture that is next to it.  You do not have control of the picture, you cannot keep somebody else from looking at the picture, you cannot keep somebody else from replicating that picture.  If I take down the picture, there is nothing you can do about it.

This is drastically simplified, but it's the *basic* premise.  An NFT is proof of your place in somebody's digital ledger, which is associated with some file on the internet - an image, a sound file, a video clip - but does not actually convey ownership of the file.

For you, you will at *best* be able to sell your spot in line to somebody else for more than you bought it worth.

&gt; What a journey it has been. It all started with the Abolition of Work

Without being forced to work for 8-10 hours or even longer. Holy shit, America has it really bad. But it's not like social democracies are better either.

&gt; And well regarding the experience with r/antiwork... long story short: I had lots of fun with anarchists and other radicals, brilliant discussions the almost 2 years I was active there (before I was invited to be a mod) and I'm honestly not sad that the liberals, with their failed reformism, as history always shows, are mad at me.

&gt; What I am: I'm disappointed. At the people not even reading the sidebar - the introduction pieces and slowly co-opting antiwork in an idea it never was.

&gt; Let me make it clear as a post-left Anarchist.

&gt; I don't fucking care about your democracy - the tyranny of the majority (well, supposedly, but the rich are ruling us right now - I care about my own well-being, about my willful self-creation. I care about to live. And if I see someone else sad, I'm sad too.

&gt; And it was making me sad how r/antiwork slowly was dying to liberals. The original userbase was full of radicals, a lot of anarchists and there were several discussions in subreddits where radicals frequented how it's just full of liberals now that want ""nicer bosses"" - even though the structure itself is just shit. I tried listening to community feedback and was actively trying to implement them in the 28 days I was modding - to the point of sleep deprivation today with 3 hours of sleep. Ironic, isn't it?

&gt; I actually thought about deleting Reddit the same day I got invited, as I was reading https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/return-fire-vol-4-supplement-caught-in-the-net - the dangers about companies, monopolies, capitalists, owning not only the physical space through private property, but also the internet itself. NFT were almost an evolution of property - making particular pieces in the internet itself being owned by someone. I guess it kind of failed?

&gt; Anyways, I'll deleting my Account soon and I'll be focusing on doing mutual aid in real life.

NFT were almost an evolution of property - making particular pieces in the internet itself being owned by someone. I guess it kind of failed?
&gt; 
&gt; Anyways, I'll deleting my Account soon and I'll be focusing on doing mutual aid in real life.
&gt; 
&gt; And for any Anti-Worker reading this, no, not the liberals, let me tell you this:
&gt; 
&gt; Our rights were fight for on the street, not begged in front of a capitalist that couldn't care less.

The blockchain technology crypto is built on is horribly inefficient and ineffective, most of the problems it ""solves"" are ones unique to the technology itself, and most of the proposed future implementations are things it would actually be terrible at. The tech bros who created it are either so egotistical they can't perceive of a world where they can't solve problems with code, because they understand one complicated thing and so assume all other things must somehow be less complicated, or they realize they can't solve problems with code and instead just say shit to push the grift forward. Crypto and NFTs are going to be a problem for the rest of us, because even if we don't buy into the grift the people behind it are well-connected enough that they might force their hypercapitalist ideals and systems onto us anyway.

A breakdown in trust of anything a person cannot themselves personally verify has created this group of easily grifted people. Thousands of grifters are after their money.

Reddit_Comments,Purple_Plus,"1. There's a slight but not huge difference, the major difference is that fans can't play sequels to the games they love without buying a new machine which isn't the case when it's done internally through ""second party"" studios. But generally it's not games being exclusive that worries me.

2. And I'm worried that in the future all users will be funneled into the metaverse (as mentioned in Activisions letter, it's a huge part of their future with Microsoft). If you think microtransactions are bad now imagine the possibility with NFTs etc. in the metaverse.

3. It makes sense from a business standpoint but that's irrelevant when it comes to what is good for the consumer and the industry as a whole in the long run.

4. I don't really understand this point and how it relates.

5. Being a fanboy of a console when you are no longer a teenager is pretty ridiculous imo, of course people have their preferences but people treat it like supporting a football team. Healthy competition is best for everyone but I'm not sure how you can have healthy competition in the long-term when one company is worth so much more than the other.

Reddit_Comments,Wild_Loose_Comma,"Okay, so you're ""wallet"" is just a digital address, and there's no ""do you accept button"". Also because its a blockchain (think of big excel sheet where you can only add rows to change data), you're ""coins""/""NFTs"" only exist on the blockchain. People have digital ""keys"" that let them look at what they own on the chain and let them interact with the blockchain to move assets around to others. So what Flocka was looking in those videos was a website that used his ""look at what I own""-key and showed him all the NFTs he had. But, as cryptobros are so proud of, NFTs (which are just digital tokens) can have code attached to them, called ""smart contracts"". So Flocka didn't know those NFTs someone sent him had this code attached, and once he tried to interact with them they activated to transfer money to another adress. And because code is the only verifying factor of any crypto technology, as long as the rules of the code were followed the transaction is valid.

ELI5: Think of the NFTs that were sent to flocka like paintings. Someone sent Flocka three paintings which were just delivered straight into his home. When he unpacked these paintings, he saw they had a QR code on them, which he scanned on his phone. When he did so, in addition to saying ""These paintings are Wocka Flockas now!"", it went into his bank account and sent $19k into an anonymous account.",245,htd2699,t1_htbd8kg,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/s5f2um/crypto_enthusiast_flood_rtechnology_and_clash/htd2699/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

Not everyone is as invested in confirmation bias as you. Interesting that you still decided not to link it. Maybe because you know you're full of shit?

&gt; nd I mean the info about the nft market was in the 10q yet the wsj claimed that the 30% movement was due to this, 

First of all the information in the 10Q was a lot more vague than the information in the ar ticle that you didn't read. The 10Q only says ""we are exploring opportunities in blockchain, NFT, and Web 3.0 technology"" there's no substance there. Not even to mention that statement is given in the context of risk, not growth. 

Second of all the WSJ article **never** mentions the 30% movement after-hours. You're lying in order to mix up time lines and make your conspiracy fit.

Also you do know that good companies make profits throught the year and don't rely on seasonal sales to recover losses?

Also no matter the definition of paperhands you do seem to belong to a group that cares about what people do with their money? Do you realise the hypocrisy of your arguments?

Can you even point out how GameStop plans to solve any of the issues that you mentioned? Because game publishers that are interested in NFTs are selling cosmetics, allowing resale of digital games would be met loss for them and you need to offer more than just speculation to why game publishers will allow resale by a third party and axe their own feet .... That is not considering how laughable the ownership argument is, none of the tech is tied to a individual's biometrics, they are tied to an account and those that maintain that account can also easily take away or alter my ownership.

Reddit_Comments,Tygiuu,"&gt;Also how can you be so sure of GME's plans when they themselves have not shared any outlook for their future plans?

All you have to do is look at their hiring page to see what they want to do, I can also look back and see that Q4 is almost always where they make the most money per quarter every year.

&gt;I care about other people egging the gullible into financial ruin. Also if you don't care about what people do with their money why do you support a group that asks people to hold and not realise gains and tries to shame people who sell by calling them paperhands?

Selling at a loss is what gets you called paper-hands, but if you cry about selling on gains when your sold share goes higher, then you're still paper-hands since you can only blame yourself for it.

&gt;Expansion plans into already established territory where one has little experience is not really great idea without a USP and blockchain really does not offer any special benefits than say Steam marketplace. Not to mention you talked abt having no debt but they raised capital to pay the debt and has actually posted only losses last two quaters. But even if these were clear positives you still think worse than normal pay and hours combined with consumer unfriendly practices are justified? 

It differs from Steam because you don't actually own any games through Epic/Steam/etc. If any of these digital retailers wanted to take the asset of your library, they could. Can you resale your digital games?

NFT/Blockchain/Web3 could be the game changer to making these things actually your assets. Is that for certain?

Reddit_Comments,tfaddy2,"Afaik, ""randomized"" NFTs just use a combination of pre-made art assets. Likely involving different layers of images, with each one corresponding to a type of ""part"" (i.e, a layer for hats, another for outfits, one for facial expressions, etc), it's only randomized whether an NFT will use hat 1 or hat 2.

Reddit_Comments,R_Sholes,"&gt; Yes, but the point is the artist doesn't need that recording company to manage distribution anymore

They just need it to manage the production, publicity, marketing, broadcast agreements, and so on. Sure.

The artist will just have to figure out the compliance with laws regarding sales and taxes everywhere they are planning to sell their records, like the tax on that resale ""tax"".

You might'n't've noticed, but many artists today have ""unique digital way"" of connecting with their fans via things like Patreon.

Why talk about fans and ownership when the only ""unique digital way"" NFT adds is... uh, more ways for scalping encouraged by the artist?

&gt; You wouldn't build one yourself. NFT ticketing platform would exist on smart contract on a permission-less open network. 

Who's providing PoS integration for selling the tickets in person? Who's providing integration for checking the tickets at the entrance? Who's providing integration with your website?

Who's providing the maintenance of all of the above, plus the ""new type of crypto-organization called a DAO where ownership is distributed among its users who vote on the the rules""?

Because, as we know, once you deploy a DAO contract, it must be immutable and unfixable, as the investors of [the original DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_%28organization%29) would surely agree. Oh, wait, that one required people begging the Ethereum maintainers for an emergency patch to freeze the funds, then another emergency patch fixing a DoS vulnerability introduced by the emergency patch, then another patch to redistribute the funds.

&gt;How do you think your computer knows that the update is being downloaded from apple?

Because they have a third party - DigiCert High Assurance EV Root CA - which vouches for authenticity of the certificate provided by apple.com's server.

&gt; or even better: In the unregulated market of online drug venders; how do you think the drug buyers know that the vender is who they say they are?

I don't think darknet market users generally care about exact identities of each other, but you would have to rely on a third party/parties for verification, arbitration and escrow all the same.

&gt; In short: It can be cryptographically proven. If you are interested you can read up about PGP encryption.

Yes, by having some third party verify the identity of the key owner. And yes, even if you just find out the ticket NFT's address from the artist's website, you're ultimately trusting third parties like the same DigiCert, which you in turn can verify by clicking the lock icon in your browser's address bar.

Many people were burned by trusting yet another, much more unreliable, third party (web search engines) when looking up cryptowallets and such, and ending up on a scam site - forgetting that Google and co. are shit at vetting their ads.",449,hr584pr,t1_hr52xkf,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr584pr/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

You mean if the artist stops distribution then your proof of ownership is meaningless because there is no where to redeem your license. Yes, but the point is the artist doesn't need that recording company to manage distribution anymore.  They can utilize the shared resource of an open source global network to manage sales.  NFT operates on a programmable smart contract where you can add a ""tax"" to the resale or airdrop digital collectables. 

It gives artists a cryptographic connection to their fans in a unique digital way. 

&gt;Without any third party, except for whoever provides a nice NFT ticketing platform for all the management stuff and integration at the venue, because why the fuck would you build one yourself?

You wouldn't build one yourself. NFT ticketing platform would exist on smart contract  on a permission-less open network. The point of the smart contract is it not managed in a traditional way.  Its rules are known before hand and agree to the rules by choosing to participate, or some operate under a new type of crypto-organization called a DAO where ownership is distributed among its users who vote on the the rules.

Reddit_Comments,R_Sholes,"&gt; Your information wont be public, the information is private. The FACT that the medical passport is OWNED by you is public. Whats in it is not. You have to give permission for people to access. 

If the information is stored on some private servers, they can verify the access. They still can (and should) encrypt it. That's orthogonal to the blockchain.

The potential hack wouldn't involve ""changing all the information on all the nodes"", it would involve leaking your private keys (accidentally or in a hack) and giving everyone access to read and write your records.

If it's on a public blockchain, you can't just send a note and revoke the key - someone would just need to share a few hundred bytes to keep all your records accessible forever. They could even upload the leak to a blockchain, for extra layer of irony.

&gt; Right now you DONT. The idea is that with ssid, blockchain and nfts. You WILL. Not that it currently is. It WONT be some private database. If its implemented it will be accepted by everyone. THATS the idea.

Who verifies that you're actually the one you claim to be? How do you revoke it? How do you ensure that sites you've granted access to your data actually delete it once you're done?

&gt; The asset would technically be decentralized. Meaning there‚Äôs no central database that contains which asset belongs to who. Its a blockchain. Everyone in the ecosystem will make up the database collectively. Making it secure. Thats what blockchain is

Your Steam inventory is pretty secure already. Even more secure, because if you lose or leak your password, you can write to their support and recover your inventory even if the hacker moved it already.

Freely sharing assets between games often mentioned in relation to this is a poorly thought out pipe dream - even if you'd manage to get to an agreement on file formats and such, why would other players want to see your, I dunno, Homer Simpson with an AK-47 in Elder Scrolls Online? And that's even before getting into actual mechanics and balance.

And I've asked many times to show any place in the token where that happens. You keep repeating ""intrinsically linked"" but can't elaborate how exactly does this manifest.

&gt;I moved on from BAYC long ago and only include them to answer your specific questions about them. Its you that are still bring them up. Ask yourself why, not me. 

Refer to the previous ""bruh, this you"". I've started talking about NFTs in general, to which you've indignantly replied that you were talking about BAYC specifically, now that I'm asking you about BAYC in which you've definitely ""looked into"" and you go ""forget it, we've moved on"".

Pick one.

&gt; I am and have always talked about the actual legal implications. Not whether it holds to some kind of professional standard. 

Yes, and I have always talked about the same. You've started the discussion with your claim about an NFT's ""inherent license"" (which you still refuse to explain) and when pointed to the actual, explicit, external agreement which doesn't appear to include a clear IP transfer clause, you go ""well, it's piss poor"".

&gt; How do I give you a public key?

Assuming you're on Windows, you could, for example, download GPG4Win and run Kleopatra. Installation wizard will help you create a certificate, and double clicking it would give you the public key.

You're from EU, I thought you'd be more aware of digital certificates tho, they were given legal status since like 20 years ago.

&gt; All I had to do to buy a monkey was click ""buy"" on Opensea.

Pretty sure you're missing steps like ""download and configure a wallet"" and ""acquire some ETH"". Last one's a bit involved and expensive than what I've just explained.

I'm also pretty sure all that magic just happens by itself, including the site just springing up fully formed from Ethereum's fruitful loins, no way it could be replicated with ancient tech.

&gt; ""I've looked into BAYC and they bundle the transfer license with the artwork, which is only possible due to them using NFTs. Thats a slight leg up.""

Why are you constantly flip-flopping between what is and what could be?

You've got some balls demanding a good faith discussion when you're constantly running between two positions, whichever is convenient for you.

&gt; Edit: Also, after taking a second pass through the comment before posting it, its clear you have no clue what goes on in legal classes. It might surprise you to learn that when I was taught contract/agreement law we were presented with imperfect contracts and then asked to ""solve"" their outcomes. Not once would we be presented with the ""perfect contract"". (which also isnt a thing, but, again, besides the point)

&gt; ""Vague formulations"", as you put it, is the bread and butter of contract law classes.

Is that ""charitably engaging in the actual discussion""?

So you know this license would get you smacked if you'd try to present it in a class, not even speaking about your legal department, and you call that ""looked into BAYC""?

Actual legal departments are anal about even more carefully worded licenses, and you claim that they'll just wave through your ""no worries bro, it's on blockchain, and it says you Own The Art elsewhere""?

&gt;Mate, I'm not even american so obviously my language will be a bit ""off"" and you somehow thought that licenses tied to NFTs must me tried in court before reaching a legal effect. 

Mate, you still didn't show how licenses are ""tied"" to NFTs - you'd have to show that before it could be even tried in court.

You just keep waving your hands while repeating ""it's inherent"" and ""it's implicit"", while fully knowing that implicit licenses don't transfer the rights, and refuse to elaborate how are they ""tied"".

You can't even do that for the example you've brought up yourself (which is now bad and imperfect. I'm sure you looked it up reeeeal good when you first brought it up, surely, and just couldn't find a better example, for reasons).

&gt; I couldnt, because once again its not about single transaction situation. 

You weren't talking about transactions, you were talking about ""replicated or faked"".

But sure, let's chain some, should we?

\&gt;Why would a ticket seller put tickets on a blockchain? Don't give me that ""resellable"" BS argument because they can enable ticket resales much easier without a blockchain - they would just have to update their existing database/website to support this.

\- NFT tickets can be inscribed with exclusive art for say a kanye west concert. Which could then mean it could be worth something as its an exclusive collectors item from a once in a life time kanye west concert. 

\- Thanks to smart contracts, any revenue you gain from selling the ticket  to collectors can automatically pay the workers involved in the event. The security, the artist, the light guy, the cleaning guy, whatever. No middle man, just instant. You get a slice of the pie too of course. 

\- Thanks to the blockchain, companies can monitor the tickets (well, anyone can) and prevent scalping, fraudulent exchanges. Also thanks to the blockchain, people can very easily verify if a ticket is legit or not. 

\&gt;Putting my health information on a public blockchain? No thanks.

? what do you mean your health information is public? Why would it be public? Your medical passport's ownership will be public, people can see it belongs to you and you can verify that this medical passport is yours. People cant access the information within without YOUR permission, that's the plan at least. 

I dont know why you imply that its not secure having information on the blockchain. Blockchain is very secure to hacking. If people change information on one computer, it wont reflect on other computers within the blockchain. People can cross reference and know something's off. 

NFTs in healthcare has potential where your medical records can be updated and shared between you and medical personnels anywhere in the world. You can receive updates instantly, close communication loops and doctors can follow up with your case fairly quickly compared to traditional hospital communication. Why NFTs and blockchain? well why not? why invent a new thing when the technology already exists. Its universal, it already exists, the technology is secure and efficient as is. 

\&gt;What would anyone gain from this over what we have today? (Identity)

Self sovereign identity. Control over who you are online. Being able to verify who you are and verify your credentials and widely accepted across all corners of the digital world. Your identity is not controlled by the government or any other third parties. Any data of us online is owned by us and anyone who wants to get their hands on it need our permission.

I don‚Äôt get Tik Tok either. 

But I do get crypto currency, block chain, and NFTs.

Let me be clear: The Emperor Wears No Clothes

You aren‚Äôt missing anything. The more you understand the technology, the more you understand that it only serves two purposes: money laundering, and market manipulation scams.

Without typing out pages, let me try to put it as succinctly as possible:

-	People figured out that financial markets are highly regulated and hard to abuse
-	What if we create a proxy market based on anonymous(*) transactions? Decentralized so nobody can easily shut us down, anonymous so that nobody can come after us, and we make it exceedingly high tech so that well intentioned digital hippies will think it‚Äôs going to change the world
-	Now that we have an unregulated market, we can run every game in the book. People with much bigger pockets know that if nobody is watching over their shoulder, they can arbitrarily move the market wherever they want, profiting coming and going. This was a severe issue in the early days of Bitcoin, and is well documented but not as well as it should be.
-	Not only can we rig the markets, now we can move a lot of money across borders.

* cryptocurrency isn‚Äôt really anonymous for most people, but for criminals, it is

The only real ‚Äúvalue‚Äù that cryptocurrency actually brings to the table is facilitating criminal transactions. Outside of that it‚Äôs purely investment speculation. 

Think about that‚Ä¶the value backing the asset is essentially that it facilitates illegal transactions. It‚Äôs worth money because of the value it provides to organized crime. Nobody really acknowledges that in a direct way. People pretended for a few years that it was some sort libertarian utopia in the making, and that it would change finance forever. Then people realized the truth, pretended that they were suddenly becoming aware of the environmental impact, and pivoted into the current aimless game of hot potato that we see now. All these coins and tokens and not one problem solved, other than how to launder money and more easily scam people.",349,hr3w9c5,t1_hr2s5zc,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr3w9c5/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

The fine art world is realistically *incredibly* small. Literally two companies handle  the vast majority of high value art trades.

Reddit_Comments,spanctimony,"So let‚Äôs go down that path for a second, because I agree, this is is the closest NFTs come to having a valid purpose.

Let‚Äôs say that your copy of Marvel vs Capcom 2 for PS3 was authenticated by blockchain and it‚Äôs universally agreed upon that you have a proper and valid license to that software.

Does that license then compel Sony to make that content available to you in perpetuity? 100 years from now if you want to download it, should you be able to? 

I think we all agree that‚Äôs a bit absurd, but where is the line drawn? 

Next question is, why on earth would Sony agree to such a thing? Right now, you can‚Äôt resell your digital goods at all! That sounds like things are just how they would like it. Why would they put a lot of effort and expense into engineering a system that enables the public to give them less money?

And then let‚Äôs say, maybe the gamers unite. And stand up and force Sony to offer such a system. Damnit, I should be able to resell my Sony games, and I won‚Äôt buy anymore if I can‚Äôt!

NFTs all come down to two single fatal flaws:

-	Ownership means nothing without the authority to enforce that ownership (and thus any system of ownership is inherently NOT decentralized)
-	Centralized authorities have better, more efficient, well established means of tracking ownership

Reddit_Comments,pitifulenergy,"&gt; They simply tie the artwork to a license that cant be disentangled

It can be disentangled if it turns out that the image is a derivative work, or if someone obtains an NFT from someone else through fraud, or if there is some dispute over the interpretation and legality of the license, for example. In my opinion this is basically the central problem with the entire crypto industry: they have looked at finance and commerce and noticed it's very complicated and messy, and they think they can reinvent the economy to be much simpler and more clear-cut. But they haven't recognised that the main reason for all the complexity and messiness is because finance and commerce are attempts to abstract all kinds of complicated, messy, physical goods and processes. The traditional ways in which we deal with problems such as inflation/deflation, fraud and plagiarism are far from perfect, but the crypto industry has simply tried to wish away these problems instead of making any attempt to deal with them. And as a result it's absolutely plagued with all of these problems.

&gt; Its not some massive revolutionary idea or application but it is a significant streamlining of a previously multi-step process. 

Where exactly is this ""significant streamlining""? Especially since most of the rights that are being sold are things that just... wouldn't have been sold outside the context of the NFT craze. Afaik people aren't optioning screenplays or signing record deals on OpenSea - they're selling rights to crappy, mass-produced digital cartoons, which in most cases the buyers probably won't do anything significant with. Prior to the NFT craze nobody wanted to buy these kinds of rights, no matter how easy or ""streamlined"" it would have been.

Also it should be pointed out that many NFTs don't come with any commercial rights to the underlying work, and that even if they do they can be limited in surprising ways (e.g. buying a Bored Ape NFT allegedly gives you the right to sell products with your particular ape image on them, but not the Bored Ape name or logo, and at least one company has fallen afoul of this already).",357,hr3f6r0,t1_hr2pnew,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr3f6r0/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0
Reddit_Comments,R_Sholes,"You didn't tho. You've evaded the question about the actual license:

&gt;You've just claimed elsewhere that the medium doesn't matter for the contract, and a contract on a napkin would do.

&gt;Pick one or another.

I already explained this to you in response to another comment but sure, here it is again. 

The medium doesnt matter for the legal implication of an agreement. It can be an NFT, napkin, or a regular contract. 

The unique characteristic of NFTs isnt *legal* its *technological*. 

NFTs allow for the bundling of the work and the licence in a way that is functionally inseperable. 

Thats unprecedented. 

The legal implication of the NFT and the license is the same as a napkin and a commissioned artwork is. 

The benefit is that a napkin cant be made inseparable from a painting, an NFT artwork and its license can. 

*Thats* the difference. 

&gt;And also linking to that other comment of yours - you're just switching interchangeably between a specific NFT and what NFTs could do in general again.

Yeah and as I said in the other comment my whole point has always been about what NFT as a technology *can* do, and I've used BAYC as an example of a way to do it. 

Where BAYC fails but which the NFT still holds a sollution for cant be held against NFTs as its own thing, but a failure of this particular project.",328,hr3bjvv,t1_hr33oa8,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr3bjvv/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0
Reddit_Comments,R_Sholes,"&gt; ""I've looked into BAYC and they bundle the transfer license with the artwork, which is only possible due to them using NFTs. Thats a slight leg up.""

And that was a lie, because I've looked at the BAYC token, and they contain no mentions of license, copyright, or transferability. So which specific NFTs are you talking about, again?

&gt; And if we instead then look at NFTs, specifically BAYC, well then the transaction is much simpler.

And if we look at BAYC, as I said, there's nothing in the token itself that even mentions the license or terms of use. You have to go to https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/terms and read through it to make sure its actually viable.

For example, does that token sale from the commissioner to the second buyer actually involve selling the copyright?

Because while it states that ""you own the underlying Bored Ape, the Art, completely"", it also clarifies that you're only entitled to ""Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Yuga Labs LLC grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art"". Nothing about permission to sublicense or further transfer of ownership.

&gt; That cant be done with NFTs which have been constructed such that the licence and artwork is inseparable. 

And there we go again, BAYC = NFTs in general, until they don't.

Also, consider that the way ""NFTs bind the license and artwork"" is just a digital signature of the artwork's hash. Do you think digital signatures didn't exist until blockchains?",257,hr3bikc,t1_hr39569,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr3bikc/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

Yes from, about, this august that is definitely the case.

Reddit_Comments,Allahambra21,"&gt;My internet is bad rn so did you catch the edit I made about how many NFTs are stolen works? The ""trustlessness"" is the problem. There is a massive problem artists have with OpenSea and some other NFT sites recently that do not verify the identity of artworks being upload and the site refuse to take action or refund for sales of stolen works.

I'm just gonna repaste what I wrote below.

NFT is just a technology. 

""T-shirt printing"" doesnt ensure that every person putting a print on a t-shirt own the copyright to said print either. Which I can vouch for from walking the streets of barcelona and at every corner seeing a street peddler selling t-shirts with mickey mouse on it. 

Is this then a fault of ""t-shirt printing""? Should you and I take opposition to the technology of putting print on t-shirts because some people use it to breach copyright?

&gt;Most professional artists have TOS on their commission sheet that discuss what they're willing to do. Idk your personal experience but most artists I know are fine discussing terms if the work involve more complicated details. Obviously if you're looking for commercial works then I would suggest working with artists with more professional experiences than personal ones.

Thats great but I'm no millionaire and while I've engaged with both commercial and retail artists that are open for provision I think you underestimate the financial gate keeping preventing most regular people like me to commission from what you seem to deem ""professional artists"". 

No offence. 

&gt;It's inConvIEnCe to discuss with artist but it's ok to spend like 8k on a dubious jpeg that might be stolen? Oh ok


Yeah this is the point where its kinda clear you're not actually willing to discuss in good faith. 

There are like less than a dozen NFT artwork collections that are priced 8k or more. 

Its like complaining about how expensive it is to commission artwork because the Mona Lisa is priced in the millions.

Reddit_Comments,Allahambra21,"&gt;See, the apes are procedurally generated, and can often differ on only a few minor traits, including expression and clothing. The fact everybody has a commercial copyright to their specific ape implies that others don't. But then there's a problem with derivative works; if I own Bored Ape #5013, a smiling green Ape, but want him to look angry, that might actually be Bored Ape #3101. Or it might get even more complicated; maybe Bored Ape #3101 has a different hat on, so my angry #5013 is actually one trait off both characters.

Yes there is definitely a risk here, but I want to point out that this isnt inherent to NFTs. 

Its an issue for BAYC because they're randomly generated and look so similar, not because of some inherent characteristic of NFTs. 

To bring it back to commissions. An artist could be commissioned to make and transfer the IP of several very similar creations, and this could present the same risk as you're describing above.

Reddit_Comments,Allahambra21,"&gt;Which lawschools teach NFT law? I'm sure there's lots of precedent for you to speak so confidently about NFTs legal status, too.

And IP agreement could be written on a napkin. 

The nature of the medium is irrelevant to the legal standing and implication of an agreement (or contract, in the napkin case). 

You dont need to teach an NFT law class for this, same as you dont need to teach an email law class in order to understand agreements made over email. 

Genuinely, this is like the weakest attempt at a gotcha I've ever seen. 

&gt;They don't have any inherent license. They might represent some parties agreeing to something (and I don't think this have been litigated for now), but that agreement may or may not include copyright transfer.

I'm specifically talking about BAYC (Apes), and they do. 

Also ""hasnt been litigated for now"" means nothing. It literally means nothing. 

Again, to take the same example, the first agreement made over email didnt have to be litigated for lawyers to confidently conclude that it would hold up as a legally binding agreement. 

There is nothing about NFTs or Blockchain that change the considerations of agreements or contracts. 

I dont know if this is some weird and widespread anti-NFT talking point because I've heard it a lot, and all I can say is that its just absolute nonsense. There is no substantive argument there. Its a handwaivey hope that a court will for some god forsaken reason decide to rule against all past precedence. 

Which is not exactly likely.

NFT is just a technology. 

""T-shirt printing"" doesnt ensure that every person putting a print on a t-shirt own the copyright to said print either. Which I can vouch for from walking the streets of barcelona and at every corner seeing a street peddler selling t-shirts with mickey mouse on it.

Reddit_Comments,Milskidasith,"Well, that's the other issue: The conflation between ""art"" and ""Art"".

The branding on my HP monitor is ""art"" in the former sense, but I think almost anybody would struggle to argue it's ""Art"" in the latter sense.

When NFTs talk about ownership ""like physical art"" and the future of artists, they're co-opting the language of ""Art"": creator-driven pieces, often that either try to say something or at least depict what the creator wanted to or how the creator wanted to depict it. Using that language to defend mass-producing random picrew avatars generated for sale, using those methods purely because they're the most utilitarian way to create a hierarchy of ape rarity, is still kind of weird. They're ""art"", sure, but I think as far as mass produced works go there's some intangible distinction between the ""Art"" of Warhol *choosing* to say ""boring modern conveniences like mass produced soup cans are great"" by mass producing soup can paintings and, like, just mass producing apes (or mass producing actual soup cans).",208,hr2y6hy,t1_hr2wi8k,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr2y6hy/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

Warhol painted soup cans to say something about modern culture; from what I recall, he was generally against abstraction.

Does a set of algorithmically generated NFT characters created to make money and to create an exclusive social club equally constitute art? Does it lack some required message or purpose beyond making money? Is it *unintentionally* art, by providing social commentary in the abstract about financialization?

Reddit_Comments,F0RGERY,"Actually, NFTs are a modern expression of a Classical art style which first originated in Ancient Greece. While it has mostly been an underground movement, the community has evolved several times over the centuries, recreating and repurposing existing techniques for new depictions of raw emotion and impressions. Modern appreciators of the movement credit Samuel Thompson as being the frontrunner, though his works could be considered low brow, if not outright crude by today's standards. 

Since his time, while the movement has rarely been thrust into the greater artistic community, there have been dozens of amateur and even professional practitioners, from William Chaloner to C.L. Blood to Victor Lustig. One frequently underlooked amateur of the craft was Fernando Wood, who later became mayor of New York City and even a U.S. Congressman in his time.

NFTs are actually a great example of the movement's basis on how artists can convey emotions; They display confidence, vanity, opportunism, incredulity, and of course, innocence. NFTs are emblematic of a greater expression beyond simply their juvenile appearances, and it really takes some gifted talent to both appreciate their ability to sway people, and to draw ire and detraction from those who fail to understand the deeper meanings.

&gt; unfortunately, if this doesnt really make sense or seem like any logical person would be happy about this exchange, then you've understood it perfectly",286,hr2bxf9,t1_hr2as0q,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr2bxf9/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

This is just one application but this is a young technology and will expand to other fields.

Reddit_Comments,kare_kano,"I used to think so too, until I ran into some examples of the use of the technology that are genuinely useful (or could be). Some off the top of my head:

* You get a book. How do you know it's the exact book that the author wrote, worked on with their original editor, and published? With paper books you can compare editions but good luck getting a first edition of certain books. And some of us like the convenience of digital copies. You could have something like a website owned by the author's estate, or by the Library of Congress, that has a genuine copy, but it's still a single place. Maybe it gets destroyed or tampered with. NFT is a method of making such a digital copy tamper-proof and unique.
* Crypto is usually associated with mining but it can also be used like company shares, except for all kinds of other purposes and without all the hassle. A project can issue a fixed number of coins (no mining needed) and sell them to gain capital. The coins can be verified, can't be counterfeited, can't decide to sneakily mint some more after the first batch etc. They can be used by the people who bought in to redeem a product, to have a say in the project's direction, to redeem services and yes, even traded for a profit if the project is useful and the coins have a useful value in its context.
* Another use of crypto would be as a web-specific currency built-into browsers. You go to a website that wants to make some money off a page, like an article. The browser could have a wallet where you've loaded a few cryptocoins worth a couple of dollars, and the page could ask you for a fraction of a cent to see the article (that's how much ads make nowadays). You decide if you want to see the article, the website makes its fraction of a cent, there are no ads anywhere anymore, and websites are also forced to define much better what exactly it is you're paying for (can't just ask money for random pages like they do with ads, they need to convince you there's something valuable there, like an article or review).

The last one will probably never happen because Google makes Chrome which has like 90% market share and Google lives on ads, while Firefox is kept alive also by Google, and Apple wants you to use Apple Pay.

In a lot of areas we have these 3rd parties that exist just because we need a trusted group to view and interact with the database on behalf of both parties.

For me, the biggest reason is that artists like Grimes, who don't really need the money, are selling NFTs that will probably be worthless in a few years for millions of dollars.

Yes - art has been dealing with the issue of value for a while now. I can easily see the prestige in owning an NFT of an iconic work of performance art, or conceptual art. It‚Äôs grimey and mercenary but that‚Äôs nothing new.

But the actual things people are buying ‚Äúownership‚Äù of are just ‚Äî nothing. I don‚Äôt know how else to put it. No one actually wants one of those horrendous monkey drawings. I don‚Äôt think you have to dismiss the concept of digital ownership to dismiss the current NFT landscape.

&gt; Real talk, tho: they're speaking about the internet from a business stand-point, I assume. Which...also doesn't make sense because before the dot com bust, people were crazy about putting shit on the web

Right - this doesn't make a lot of sense to me either. As one of the biggest business uses was payment processing that came around in '94ish or so? before then, you had to take credit card payments using carbon paper and submit the copies manually.

the vision and the idea was there.

i don't see a vision for NFTs that isn't tailored to speculation, gambling, money laundering, or grifting.

that also applies to crypto - bitcoin has been around for ~10 years and while it's valuation has spiked, what usefulness is there? i was around when bitcoin was super cheap, and i didn't buy into it then, but I thought it might have a future in porn - payment processors hate dealing with porn/porn sites (e.g. onlyfans drama re: pulling NSFW content due to pressure applied by...visa? i forget, and then abruptly reversing the decision.)

Secondary markets worked for ohysicalcmedia, because the disk existed, and could be sold. Why would a publisher allow you to redistribute your digital licence, when they can sell another customer the *Exact. Same.Product* for full price? Do you see what I mean? Thet would have to allow a secondary market. And they could just as easily label an NFT-based secondary license market as piracy, whether they choose to take a cut or not, as that license to play is the thing they hold the rights to.

Reddit_Comments,Hard_Corsair,"It's a valid question, and there are a few reasons, but the big part of it comes to cutting out distributors. Let's pretend I'm a AAA game studio, we can call me Ubihard. I make my new game, Near Shout 7. I then sell it on Steam and Xbox Live and PSN. Each of those platforms take 30%, which on a $60 came is $18. However, people want a central store that they can buy all their games from, with a central account that those games are stored to, so they continue to use Steam/Xbox/PSN.

&amp;#x200B;

Alternatively, I sell my game as an Ethereum NFT. I can sell it any number of ways, and it just goes into their choice of Ethereum wallet, so all their games from all publishers can be consolidated. The fees I pay to Ethereum to process this, especially if I partner with a Layer 2 solution, are much less than the 30% I was paying a distributor, and customers go for it because it's more open and less restrictive than being locked into a distributor's ecosystem. I still get the benefits of DRM because the NFT handles that, but I don't have to do the backend work to make sure that system is secured, so it's relatively easy. But then, it gets better. I deploy my NFT games with a smart contract that gives me a 10% cut every time there's a transaction that transfers one of my NFT games, so if a game is resold for $20 then the owner gets $18 and I get $2. Customers like it because they can actually resell their digital games, while I benefit from constantly earning residual revenue from games I already sold.

Reddit_Comments,Gingevere,"&gt; The JPEG is not an NFT. The NFT is basically a Blockchain address that declares you as owner of a digital good, in some cases a JPEG which is something completely stupid, but it could be something like an asset of a game, for example characters, skins, weapons, or even the digital copy of the game. This would mean that you could resell the used digital game as you want and that steam could never revoke your license to use it. It could solve a ton of problems we currently have with microtransactions. It has a ton of potential and it would grant lot of power to the consumer.

So you can't trust someone telling you a thing represents a thing at all, because it doesn't represent whatever the picture is. However, it does represent something specific and nowhere else. Which means it can have a value unique to it, traded, tracked, so on. 

The part where scams and the crazy speculative market around it are working as well as they are is a demonstration that the core concept of tracking value and ownership works. 

But you own whatever the picture in the NFT is as much as you own a bridge I sell you. This much is true and I too am annoyed by people buying that as actually being able to own the bridge. I am also annoyed by people acting like it's just a normal digital file like any other digital file and that the thing of it that is bought and sold can be copied when it can't.",297,hoypy8y,t1_hoyj3ji,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rienpv/phil_spencer_says_that_they_will_not_add/hoypy8y/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

Except that, why would you want to sell an ""original"" digital copy? Nobody is going to buy that shit because they can just right-click and Save As.

Your entire argument hinges on the idea that anyone other than cryptobros are interested in or value a ""unique"" copy of digital art, when people who actually care about supporting artists monetarily don't need NFTs to do so.

Reddit_Comments,SeamlessR,"Well, no, to any of that, because the only reason I brought up fine art at all is because of the money laundering component. Which is the comparison to the function of NFT which whole sale does not care about the art. 

NFTs and the system for it is not about the art. Just like the value of the mona lisa is not about the art. There is value in fine art beyond its capacity to launder money obviously, but the thing that makes it valuable for laundering money happens to be the unique identifiable nature of it. 

The literal only purpose of an NFT is to be unique and identifiable. Which the system that provides that does well enough that money laundering previously only seen on the scale of fine art and antiquities scams can now be done digitally. 

With the same kind of security the physical art brought by way of being traceable, identifiable, and unique. 

None of that has any statement on the purpose of fine art or enjoyment beyond criminal enterprise. Just that one of the purposes of fine art is criminal enterprise.

Nobody in 2030 is going to be paying big bucks for their social media profile picture because supply of cool choices will catch up and the hype will die. Beanie babies 

All nfts are is a way to designate digital ownership, so asshat monkey buyers rushed in like the greedy little pigs they are and drove prices up so high that it got national attention because it was a new fad like the gold rush. 

There wont be money in it down the line except for the folks who sell something of real value at a fair price at a large scale. Think concert tickets, independent movies, early access to items, subscriptions to services, etc. this mainly just pertains to top dogs who havent switched over to blockchain yet.

Reddit_Comments,itisSycla,"The best analogy for NFTs i have came across is that they are the same as those companies that allow you to pay to name a star, or to buy a square meter of land in scotland that comes with a certificate that states you are a lord because of it.

In both cases, you just pay a company to agree with you. The star isn't named after your girlfriend because no one with authority in the field recognizes that random company as having any sau in the matter, and you are not a lord because no institution recognizes that other random company as having any authority to decide who is part of the nobility and who isn't.

For NFTs, you just replace ""company"" with ""blockchain"".

Besides, i don't get how people who were born and raised with the internet cannot spot the scam flags from miles away. Every tiktok/fb/insta video that shills for NFTs i have ever seen just says ""make an artwork and sell it!

NFTs are going to be that. An ability to know whether or not a thing is real on the digital plane in a way that hasn't been possible before due to capacity to copy. Which is why exactly the interest in NFTs now is shaped like the fine art/money laundering interest.

Reddit_Comments,ReveilledSA,"&gt;Firstly, that's why I specified ""for an exact copy"".

A print of the Mona Lisa would not be an exact copy.

&gt;Secondly, you failed to address the core point which is why anyone should care which Mona Lisa is the ""original"". Hopefully that is because you realized there is no more reason than anyone should care who owns an NFT.

I didn't address it because it's not relevant.  The story I'm relating is of a person who argued that an NFT-associated copy of a digital file was a special, higher form of art versus a non-NFT copy, and they compared detractors of this idea to someone who would argue that a print of the Mona Lisa has exactly the same artistic value as the original.  Note, not ""an exact copy of the original"", a *print*.

But, for the sake of argument, why should anyone care which Mona Lisa is the original? Personally, I don't, much.  But putting myself in the shoes of someone who does, I'd say that humans find value in things which are first.  We celebrate the people who were first to the poles, first to the moon, some of us treasure the first music album they ever bought. So when it comes to the Mona Lisa, we might similarly treasure the one which was painted first.  Beyond that, there's an element of connection.  We like to share experiences with others, particularly people who are important to us. Many people are inspired by and place great importance on individuals long dead.  Leonardo da Vinci is one of those people, and when you view the Mona Lisa, you see the same painting that Leonardo saw.  You see the brush strokes he made.  You feel the weight of centuries that seperate you, and in a tiny way, bridge that gap, if only for a moment.  This object you are viewing was once in *his* workshop, being touched by *his* brushes, being painted by *his* hands.

I don't personally feel that way about the Mona Lisa, but if someone cited those reasons as to why they'd consider the original more valuable to them than a copy, I could understand their viewpoint.  Neither of those apply uniquely to NFTs, since the NFT copy won't be the first copy, and there's nothing about the NFT version that gives it a more authentic human connection than any of the other identical copies.",404,hoy7ft2,t1_hoxzyz6,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rienpv/phil_spencer_says_that_they_will_not_add/hoy7ft2/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

TF2 hats only can exist in TF2 and on Steam. To expand to say, eBay, there would need to be a corporate partnership that allowed those goods to be traded via eBay plus the backend systems in place to facilitate the trade in-game. That‚Äôs costly and really only more convenient to the consumer. 

With NFTs, we get a ‚Äúfree market‚Äù in the trade off. Annoyed that to buy in-game items you need in-game credits that are always priced in a way that incentives you to buy more? Well on a distributed blockchain you‚Äôd just use a straight highest bidder pays in crypto method. The price of that new Halo skin that 343 is selling for $20? Well the market may say it‚Äôs worth only $3 and that‚Äôs how much it would go for until someone else with a higher willingness to pay comes along. 

The flip side is it opens up a whole new channel of monitization for companies which mainly plays off gambling tendencies and artificial scarcity. Trading becomes a second in-game mechanic that draws in players solely for the purpose of chasing profits. Which creates opportunity for scams, pump and dump schemes, etc. Basically all the things people hate about Wall Street with a THOUSAND times less regulation. 

Blockchain enables the securitization of digital goods and creates a marketplace outside any regulators control.

Do *not* lure in some cryptobros with a product that seems to be skyrocketting in price with the FOMO factor

That wouldn't be a problem, because one point commonly missed by ""you get to own your digital items!"" crowd is that some other party has to honor that.

If you have an item with a unique ID, it's trivial to ban it specifically alongside with your account. This would be true for games, and if music labels suddenly decide to allow ""used"" album sales, they'll definitely want to be able to revoke the licenses.

You might still be able to show that you owned a cool gunsword before you got banned, or that you once grabbed a rare accidentally published preview version of some album which was later revoked, but if those NFTs are in any way enforceable, you'll only actually ""own"" some weird bragging rights.

So if I screenshot, right click, or save the image some other way in essence I have the exact same thing. It would be like if any time someone bought a Mona Lisa poster magically an exact carbon copy of the painting was made.  Yeah it's not the Original but if down to the molecule its the same as the one sitting in the Louver who cares? At that point its just semantics.",139,hoxomra,t1_hoxkcm1,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rienpv/phil_spencer_says_that_they_will_not_add/hoxomra/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0
Reddit_Comments,ReveilledSA,"The problem's twofold: first, a print of the Mona Lisa won't be an exact copy of the original.  You could probably get a master forger to painstakingly recreate a copy that is so close to identical that it would be indistinguishable to almost anybody (maybe even everybody, if the forger is good enough), but that's not the same thing as making a print.

And second, the painting in the Louvre is objectively the original in a way that an NFT just isn't. An NFT of a painting is essentially a glorified receipt for a ""special"" copy, whose only special characteristic is that it comes with a glorified receipt. It's hard to even specify what an ""original"" would be for digital art (which is exactly the difference, there's no serious disagreement about which of the millions of copies of the Mona Lisa is the original), but I think it's very dubious that the definition should be ""the one with the NFT attached"".

Like, lets imagine an artist creating a painting as a thought experiment.  They work in photoshop, with a .psd file.  The .psd file is saved on a USB thumb drive.  When they're finished the painting, they do the following things in order:   
1) First, they export a PNG of the image.  This is the first time the project has been converted to a standard, viewable single image file. They sell this image to Alan, who commissioned the work.
2) Then, they export another PNG of the image. They mint an NFT of this image. They sell the NFT to Betty.
3) Then, they register the image for copyright purposes. They sell the copyright to Charlie, upload a copy of the .psd file to dropbox, and send him a link.
4) Then, they remove the pen drive containing the .psd file.  They sell the pen drive to David.

Who owns the original?  I think the question is arguably nonsensical, there's no such thing as an ""original"" when it comes to digital images.  But if I had to, gun to my head, order the owners in terms of who has the strongest claim to own the ""original"", I'd reckon that David has the strongest claim, followed by Charlie, then Alan, and Betty last of all.  Others might disagree, which is reasonable.  But unless almost everyone intuitively believes Betty owns the original, Betty's NFT is not really analogous to owning the original Mona Lisa.",408,hoxob3x,t1_hoxaio5,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rienpv/phil_spencer_says_that_they_will_not_add/hoxob3x/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0
Reddit_Comments,MercuryInCanada,"I work as a cryptographic researcher.

I'm deeply familiar with blockchain, PoW, PoS, and all that. I've written papers on blockchain, and talk with coworkers who are developing blockchain for various projects.


NFTs are the stupidest, most infuriating garbage I have ever seen. I thought blockchain evangelism was annoying as people kept trying to force blockchain into situations that did not need them, or try to solve some problem that was already answered.

NFTs, and crypto currencies, aren't really art or currencies, respectively, they're unregulated securities and investments. They're about suckering more people so a smaller group of people can get rich. Yeah you can buy things with bitcoin and etherium but why would you do that when the price is supposed to continue to climb, and then you can cash? And NFTs give their owners exactly 0 legal protection or rights. You do not own that picture, you just paid for a receipt.


Blockchain has some real value in niche situations, but it's been co opted as a get rich quick scam, with some crazed techno-utopian pipe dream that can't ever be realized. All the while consuming more energy that literal fucking countries.

is this even a good thing? Would bans in say, League of Legends be nearly as meaningful if you didn't _also_ run the risk of losing the money you've invested in it over the years? and isn't the mutability of the library the reason you buy into streaming services rather than buying an MP3 or a physical record?

I still have yet to hear someone actually explain a practical use for NFTs. I was trying to think of one and maybe if like, there could be completely unique Pokemon or something that you could get in the endgame, and that's a way to ensure it can't be duplicated?

Reddit_Comments,PresN,"But see, even in your example the ""solution"" doesn't match the ""problem"". Sure, the blockchain can hold an immutable record that the Yangshan Port Authority inspected the cargo. Lets say that there's no way to fake it- 100% this cargo got an inspection sticker by the YPA, and not some 3rd party.

100% the San Fransisco Port Authority will still inspect it. Why? Because it doesn't matter that there's a cryptographically-signed sticker from the YPA on it: the _inspection record_ isn't the _inspection_, and if the SFPA was willing to blindly trust that the YPA was inspecting things and they didn't need to double-check, then they wouldn't need to do it now either. It doesn't matter _how_ the YPA promises they inspected the cargo, via blockchain or paper ledger, you would still have to _trust_ that they _actually did it_. Blockchain adds nothing. And if they _did_ trust each other... why would you need to use the blockchain? Just use a regular database and disallow edits.

And oh look, we see the same thing with NFTs! It doesn't matter that the NFT is immutable and we can track ownership of it, it has _jack all_ to do with ownership, via IP or copyright or anything else, of the _actual artwork_.

Web3 is more about having immutable (as in can‚Äôt be changed/tampered with by literally anyone) data. Optimally you‚Äôd use the minimal amount of data possible over web3 and most of it over traditional web.

I can‚Äôt explain it quite well enough to convince someone who‚Äôs super anti-NFT without using an example so that‚Äôs the route I‚Äôll go: best applications are things like container shipping contents. Each stage of the process passes different bits of data about the container, such as what‚Äôs in it, what it weighs, who dropped it where and when, and who owns the actual metal container itself as well as much much more. Some of that data you don‚Äôt want to be fully public, but it needs to be verifiable to certain bodies. Say you export a container of cigarettes in yangshan, and have it inspected there by port authority. This is costly and takes time, but because you got their stamp on the validity of a very small number of data points, you may be able to avoid needing it to be inspected 4 more times before it reaches its destination. The blockchain was used as basically a trusted, neutral computer for storing the shared data needed for expensive operations.

The actual paperwork and transfer of ownership of the house took the normal several weeks, because it turns out blockchain doesn't actually magically replace deeds registrars, the IRS, and everyone else involved in transfers of property.

Reddit_Comments,painter-according,"&gt; Fractionalized asset ownership of things like buildings and houses.

That's called a ""timeshare"". They've existed for decades, and they're stupid.

&gt; The next generation stock market will be on the blockchain and shares will be NFT‚Äôs.

Why?

&gt; Fractionalized ownership of sports teams

Not only have publicly traded sports teams existed for many years (you could buy shares in Man United in 1892), but the crypto industry has already reinvented publicly traded companies once before. They were called ICOs, and they were complete nonsense.

&gt;  or music rights

As in, you want people to be able to buy 1% of the copyright of a song? That sounds stupid and pointless, but I'm pretty sure it's achievable already. You could just set up a company that owns the rights to the song and nothing else, and sell shares in that company.

&gt; The next generation of account security could involve NFT‚Äôs.

How and why?

&gt; Plenty more that I haven‚Äôt mentioned and plenty more that haven‚Äôt even been thought about yet.

If you could give us just one serious example, with an actual rationale for why it would be good and why it needs to involve NFTs, you wouldn't need to gesture vaguely at things that people might think up in the future.

&gt; Point is potential real use cases are everywhere. We‚Äôre just not there yet.

None of these ideas sound like they would be especially complicated to develop, and NFTs have been around for over seven years now. People have managed to develop all kinds of NFT scams and trading platforms. Why has nobody managed to do *anything* worthwhile with them yet?

&gt; The future is on the blockchain.

There is more than one blockchain, and all they are is an especially dumb database system. The idea that our entire society is going to be based around them is incredibly farfetched. Even if they are widely adopted (which I think is unlikely), they're just going to be an obscure building block for other technologies. Conventional databases have been widely adopted and are very important, but if someone 50 years ago had said ""the future is on the database"", we would think that was ridiculously pompous and over-the-top even with hindsight.

&gt; Companies are rapidly adopting that.

Not really. Also, business often makes extremely stupid decisions. Companies rapidly adopted leaded fuel, even though everyone had a pretty good idea how dangerous it was and better options were available. All they care about is their own profits, even if that means scamming or killing people.

&gt; And NFT‚Äôs will play a major role in the metaverse and real life.

I'm old enough to remember when Second Life was widely considered the future of humanity. ""The Metaverse"" literally just seems to be Second Life but Facebook.

Reddit_Comments,lool-g-lool,"The point is the signature. So, in the real world, you would sign or somehow denote that you own made that art - a physical signature or in the case of more notable works, the physical materials you used to make the painting, whatever can indicate that it is the original. In the digital world, NTF creators would hope it would be the NFT - you create a digital masterpiece, and you ‚Äúmint‚Äù it as an NFT. Now go collect your millions of eth!

Only, of course it isn‚Äôt that simple. Just as when you sell your own art in the real world, you have to find a buyer. When you find a buyer, the buyer will want to know that what you have is authentic, which is where this signature or minting comes into play. You painted the painting and included your signature along with the number of prints and what numbered print that one is. In the case of digital works, you would verify it cryptography as belonging to you.

But why would anyone want this stupid shit? It‚Äôs art. Go ask the art world. From my understanding, it has to do with money. Someone buys an original andy warhol painting, collects more, exhibits them, increasing popularity, increasing value, someone buys original, seller profits. Same thing with selling NFTs, I would imagine.

But why can‚Äôt I just sell the right clicked images? You can, because people will buy anything. This doesn‚Äôt mean that the buyers with the big bucks aren‚Äôt going to be more careful with regards to verifying authenticity.

I think theres a chance you're misunderstanding how an nft is structured. Its not based on a host or a company to hold it up. Its a decentralized system. You dont need to verify the nft after an update because its just all still there. Its a bit like saying if you log out of your email all your emails disappear.


It is not simple to copy your original nft. I'm not sure where you're getting this idea from. NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible literally means it is unique.


If I write 8384 on a sheet of paper and hand it to you. And you take a new sheet of paper and write 8384 on it and hand it back to me. Did I get the same thing back? No, I got a different unique sheet of paper with the same number on it.


If I again write the same thing down and hand it to you, you now have 2 unique things. You cant duplicate an nft. Because the copy you make isnt the NFT, it is a new thing, but it doesnt have the history of the original. And the history is part of what keeps it unique.


A ton of this stuff is open source. Its not about keeping secrets from people in the code. Most of these systems run openly. I get that some people dont like nfts and crypto and such, but there is a reason for it to exist and persist for so long even if its all a scam.

How do you think those places get tracked when they have VPNs up the asshole and servers all over the world that can be up and running within moments of a shutdown? You'd think that would be difficult to track and it somewhat is, but at the end of the day every single thing you do on your computer leaves a paper trail. So NFTs don't even add anything here. Also once the host server does go down, or the codec needs to be updated it's worthless. Like imagine for a second it was created using Adobe Flash, but Adobe flash went down recently, it's totally gone. How do you verify your NFT now? Well you can't, there'll be no host to verify against. So now you need a new code and a new identifier, however due to the nature of the system, your new NFT will technically never be the first one you had, so you'll never have what you paid for in the first place ever again. It's also simply just a copy of your original NFT. Imagine if multiple people pick up the code before then, as in it goes open source, which is constantly pushed as a positive in these arguments. Which version of the NFT code would be the legitimate version that verified what you own? After a lengthy court case to track it all down the code has changed hands 4 times, and now there are 16 different versions of the same code and your code cannot be verified in any of them.

2. Full proof to event organizers that you are the owner of the ticket


Why NFTs and not a QR code?
QR codes can be forged and sometimes contain malware. 

Okay okay, so maybe that isn't a valid enough reason to employ this mechanism, depends on who you ask I'd say. Let's look at another reason to use NFTs for ticketing.

Protection against scalping:
You can deploy smart contracts on the Blockchain which prevents resale of a ticket for a higher price. Smart contracts are a useful mechanism of Ethereum and you can implement almost any logic you want in there.

Quantum computing as an example can virtually try an infinite number of possibilities. What use is your NFT when a computer can guess the unique number through instantaneous brute force testing an infinite set of infinitely long strings? We have found two new phases of matter. One which can change when two stages without losing energy (this should be impossible) and the other is the stuff that binds entangled particles together. This all means we'll likely have some sort of tech leap within the next decade or so. I'm not holding my breath on NFTs.

My main point is even these 3d and audio files are a tiny, tiny like less than 1% part of NFTs and are very insignificant compared to the commercial use already being used and developed.   


You could get a copy of the video of my 3d art sure, but you dont have the model to move and manipulate in your own animation.

In the end an NFT is a digital token that is unique and can't be reproduced. Currently in art marketplaces they use certificates of authenticity to verify that pieces are real. The NFT aspect of diffusion at would replace the certificate.

Reddit_Comments,Superboy309,"Because you cannot reasonably sell Bitcoin for more than the market price of bitcoin, of buy them for less than the market price. The NFT provides an asset that you can artificially inflate, independent of any market, since it's unique. If you have 100 Bitcoin sitting in a wallet that's linked to ransomware and 1 Bitcoin that you've purchased with clean money, you have no way of moving that 100 Bitcoin directly to the clean wallet without it still being known as dirty. Instead, you spend the 1 Bitcoin on an NFT, which is a clean purchase, and then a month later ""random person"" (the dirty account) comes by and wants to purchase your NFT for 100x what you paid for it. Now you have 100 Bitcoin in your wallet and, if you hid your ownership of the dirty wallet well enough, it's ""clean"".

You can make this process even more powerful by, for example having the dirty account buy a bunch of cheaper, related NFTs from actual random people, and then make sure you are the one that holds the most expensive one on your clean account, so that it is sensible for the dirty account to buy it for a huge markup.",203,hojd07v,t1_hogjez3,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rfq4my/keanu_reeves_laughs_out_loud_at_a_man_trying_to/hojd07v/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,public,0

Reddit_Comments,Seaworthiness-Any,"Cryptocurrencies in themselves are nothing more than ordinary fiat money, just that you can trade them only using digital means. This makes them worse than ordinary money, which, according to gresham's law, should drive out ordinary money. I think it's just for practical reasons that this hasn't happened. If it were mandatory to own a computer, or only a smartphone, this is probably what would have occured.

NFT's are gambling of the worst kind. There is litarally a girl who sold [a fart in a glass as an NFT](https://www.thegamer.com/amouranth-fart-jar-cutie-pa-toot-ies/). More exactly speaking: she sold the right of ownership to said object. That sort of thing should usually drive away serious people, and that's not because of the fart or because of the girl. The question ""where does any surplus value come from"" is not answered, like in about 150 years of economic theory. So basically, these people try to sell ideas, which is a stupid idea, since ideas can change and are changing. You might observe that nobody appeared to be able to reproduce that girl's exploit, namely, sell their own farts in glasses to the same effect. She also wasn't able to sell a second fart. Obviously, someone buying that fart 

Concerning the fart in the glass: this is strikingly similar to [Manzoni selling canned shit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artist%27s_Shit). However, there has been just one instance, as opposed to 90. Apparently, ""reproduction"" was the hot shit of these times. Warhol sold paintings of reproduced cans of tomato soup, later the cans themselves (not without *signing them*), and Duchamps presented a urinal, not without *signing it with a wrong name*.

Apparently, nothing new can come of these things. This exposes their reality as being nothing more than pure propaganda. Even to make sense, they have to rely on a system supporting them, and, apparently accidentaly, this supporting system appears to be capitalism of the worst kind in every case. This again strikes me as odd: those people pretend to change the system, when in reality they're doing nothing more than *reproducing it on the internet*. Nobody asked them to do that, and my guess is that this will backfire in some way, sooner or later.

Accelerationism comes to mind, but then again, these people are at least honest. Crypto and NFT pundits are usually silent about the preconditions: a capitalist system and digital hardware. So in the best case they'll cause more computers to be bought - which is not as good as it looks - and the spread of capitalism. Which is as closest as you can get to the root of all evil in a capitalist system.",433,i3h5kbz,t3_twrh55,/r/AskReddit/comments/twrh55/people_of_reddit_what_is_your_stance_on_nfts_and/i3h5kbz/,1,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,,

Reddit_Comments,styiioggf,"Interesting space. If you bought a bored ape one year ago for $300 it would be worth $500,000 minimum now. Plus the $150K airdrop they gave to all holders for free. 

I think the metaverse is where nfts really shine though. Your NFT becomes your digital identity and it‚Äôs all a status game. I know the concept right now seems silly to most people but people have been collecting Pok√©mon cards, rare stamps, comics as collectibles forever. This is just a digital equivalent right now. 

People will joke about right-click-save and screenshotting. Those people were not airdropped $150K worth of apecoin. The actual owners of the NFTs were. 

It‚Äôs fascinating and I‚Äôve played around. Web3 is almost here and no matter how much ridicule it gets because of ‚Äúmonkey jpegs‚Äù I feel like it‚Äôs here to stay.
a lot of people will look back and wish they had picked up some assets with early mint dates, just like we look back wishing we had invested in that stupid pointless Bitcoin back in 2010.

Web3 is not about art. It‚Äôs about the entire ecosystem of the internet operating together on an open chain. The Open Metaverse. Everything public. You truly OWN your ingame possessions and can trade freely, or hold, or sell. 

The open metaverse also evens the playing field when it comes to the ability to earn in less developed countries. As automation removes jobs like cashiers and Uber drivers, the ability to earn moves into a virtual space. Mining for resources in games in the metaverse for example. 

It‚Äôs fascinating to me and I‚Äôll be watching every step of the way.

An Andy Warhol painting isn't \*physically\* worth very much when there are millions of good reproductions.

It's the same with NFTs.

The only reason an NFT fetches a high price is because a) it's rare b) it's famous and c) the collector has an expectation that is will fetch an even higher price in future.

Reddit_Comments,SignalGe,"that person has unfortunately mislead you.

it is not ""let's do random calculations for fun!"" it is called verification.

So, on the internet (so-called Web2) , computers can *interact*. They verify this interaction by sharing a little code, this is called a handshake

on so-called ""Web3"" computers can *transact*. This is different from paypal and venmo because the currency IS the code.

Cryptography is taking plain text and turning it into something unreadable. Each transaction is converted into a cryptographic number. To verify that a blockchain transaction is real, and not just some arbitrarily executed ""Give me 1000 bitcoin"", a bunch of computers try to recreate this cryptographic number.

If it can't be recreated, it's not a valid transaction.

This unfortunately requires a fair bit of energy, because a transaction needs to be verifiable, otherwise one person could transact everysingle bitcoin on the blockchain.


Now, most NFTs are on the Ethereum blockchain, rather than bitcoin. This *currently* uses the same method of verification, known as ""Proof of work""

Ethereum is migrating to ""Proof of stake"" within the next year - few years

It's similar - computers still have to verify transactions by performing calculations. For proof of work, computers *compete* to verify a block. Verification is ensured by the sheer number of computers. To cheat proof of work, you would need to own 51% of *every single* computer on a blockchain.

Proof of stake needs far fewer computers because the validators are chosen *randomly*. So only a few computers have to verify a given transaction, rather than every compute verifying every transaction.

This consumes a LOT less power.

But how do we ensure the randomly picked validator is being truthful?

Validators are weighted by how much Ethereum tokens they have staked, so in order to fake a transaction you would need to control the majority of all Ethereum tokens on the blockchain.

If a Validator ""lies"", the staked Ethereum will be deleted, or ""slashed"". So there is an incentive to be truthful.",318,i3gxmz5,t1_i3g0h6m,/r/AskReddit/comments/twg8nd/whats_something_thats_completely_fucking_stupid/i3gxmz5/,1,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,,

Even NFTs might have some added value in the future, although for the moment I'm really not impressed either (all the NFT ""art"" is pretty much pointless and probably a combination of money laundering and people being tricked into it). Some more realistic uses would be for ticketing or ownership of digital/real goods, but only if the NFT brings an additional value compared to current systems (so far not seen a good advantage of it).

Plus, relationships are so exhausting, expensive ($, mentally and emotionally) and can get so redundant. 

After my last relationship I had a lot more  T I M E and that is KEY! My weekends were dedicated to ex and once I got those back, I started thriving!! 

I started pursuing my hobbies. I got back into gaming, then got myself a 3D Printer (assembling it was a proud momentüò¢), I taught myself more about CRYPTO/NFTs/Digital Assests and that (still) absorbs my energy..I'm $laying it, just sayin'!! üòéAlso got an Oculus 2, some digital assets, etc. ( the real ones know ü§ë)

Also, I pivoted careers! Left the hospitality industry after over a decade with Marriott (it took such a beating over the pandemic), took some online courses about Digital Marketing, got a new job within the Marketing &amp; Creative realm where I get to WFH (or under a tree, whatevers clever) with a kickass company and am continually learning more about shit that actual interests me (tech).

Lastly, I'm humbled to have kickass friends, family, cat, I own a place (which is damn near impossible in Toronto), drive AND am in optimal health!! I never wanted kids so am I'm no rush to settle down and I love to have F U N!!

Reddit_Comments,mangotree65,"There are so many but three seem most important. The first two don't get enough mention. 

A man who displays strong admiration for celebrity businesspeople and is constantly talking about money and ""success.""  Often, what these people admire about the rich and famous is not their wealth or accomplishments, it's the power they perceive the rich to have over others. Does your date frequently mention being an ""entrepreneur?"" Obsess over cryptocurrency and NFTs? Heap praise on the wealthy while denigrating workers? Have few books but does have a prominently displayed copy of an Ayn Rand novel? If any of those are true you are likely dealing with someone who views and will treat you like a slave. 

Anyone who has a strong relationship with parents who were abusive. If he is willing to overlook past abuse he received, he's going to expect you to do the same for him. If he feels obligated to forgive or assist people solely because they are family, he is telling you he respects arbitrary social order more than reality. This is the type of person who overlooks sexual abuse by clergy and law enforcement. 

How a person treats animals, children, and people in service jobs is a big indicator of selfishness. If they are anything but kind and generous, it's just a matter of time before they display lack of respect for you. 

I'd also give a warning about men who have fallen into the bizarre cult of worship for Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, and other ""manly"" types. These are emotionally immature men who are desperate for an authority figure in their lives. This man needs to experience having a parent before they are ready for a partner.

There's a lot of pros and cons to the technology. Like, who actually legally varifies and protects ownership? If you start an NFT network to ""sell"" the content of the Louvre or any major museum, who's to stop you? What happens if the NFT network shuts down?

Reddit_Comments,austin__2,"Hello my name is Obama bing chilling (chinese name). I'm a Fortnite, Mario enjoyer from France that speak Japanese, and let me make a post to tell you about my based story.

I was corn at a hospital in Belgium in 1984. My dad was from Taiwan and my mom was from China, their bussiness was growing grass for feeding pigs and turtle. They love to bend my penis during their free time.

My first word was fuck, which made my parents go ZAMN as they expected daddy or mommy. I know I'm an idiot, but the cringe didn't last forever.

I got a cat at the age of 4, his name was Mister Chad. He love to meow while I piss on my furry friend's ass. I remembered him fart on my Cheetos and chasing my big brother's dick. Oh shit, I mean his pet koala, while I told him to cum here and stop trying to piss on that weeb femboy's titan semen.

When I was 14, we went on a trip to India to get vaccinated. We also visit the rock museum and shop at the local woman panties store. It was a great experience.

Now at the age of 28, and being a renowned biologist that published a great mount of studies on semen in Britian and the great country of America. Having good source about how to blowjob, I have decided to follow my greatest dream, which is launching an porn NFT collection with depictions of the amogus having sex with FNAF bitches covered in the iconic sticky white substance.

Our company has just launched an NFT programme which entitles the holder to a ‚Äòfree‚Äô business meeting every month.

We have a condition that every time the token is transferred, we receive X% of final sale price when converted to GBP OR if it isn‚Äôt traded within X amount of time, a tax is applied to the holder. The idea is that we will receive more money as time goes on; people will become aware that this token is actually extremely valuable because the business meeting is extremely useful. Because of this, more people will be inclined to buy and hold the token, pushing up our revenue.

In the moon scam, some random company just keeps a list of people who have paid, and that list says the purchasers ""own"" an acre of land in the moon - even though this list has no legal authority whatsoever. You're just paying a random company to put you on their own private list that means nothing.

An NFT is a digital token tracked by a random company, which keeps a list of the purchasers. Their list says that the purchasers ""own"" a specific image. For example, pictures of weird monkeys in various costumes. But, just like the moon scam, this list has no legal authority whatsoever. It's just a list kept my some random company. You are paying go be kept on that list, just for the sake of being on the list.

The reason that NFTs are so popular right now is because they're riding the wave of crypto/bitcoin popularity (they use the same technology), and because you can try and get other people to pay you to take your spot on the list. So peoples' gambling instincts kick in.

Or the sudden NFT thing, I never took part in it but it took me by surprise how fast it gained traction and the money that was thrown around in that space. Myself due to my sport I met quite a few very wealthy people and realised they didn't work a standard job all there lifes,they made and saved some money early and started some type of small company which through the years got bigger and bigger or I've met others whose families had some type of company and either lived off of that company, had the mind to take the company further up or didn't care got some money and started a normal restaurant because they didn't care about that company. For me the number one thing someone can do is find one or two hobbies where you go out and meet people.

Reddit_Comments,190bpm,"First of all, thanks for the thoughtful response.

Artists have a lot of the same complaints you do. What we're upset by are scammers. They are ""draining the liquidity from the market"" as they say. Artist sales are way down because amateur collectors get duped into buying the collectible garbage.

Low effort hustlers have flooded the market and our social media platforms. Its confusing new buyers into spending money despite a poor understanding of what they're getting into. As a result, fewer people actually go looking for legitimate art sold as nfts. Before all the Bored Apes, etc, in 2020 to early 2021, the NFT world centered around a legitimate artistic movement. Now its a cesspool of scams and the artists are hanging on for dear life.

On your other point, people shouldnt refer to artworks as NFTs. It shows a low understanding of the tech you're working with. I personally avoid speaking about my artworks as ""nfts"" because it shows a poor understanding of the tech, and I'm trying to attract savvy collectors, not fast-money FOMO buyers. When I talk about my collection i refer to my nft artworks, to distinguish assets from jpegs. Some collectors dont care about technical expertise if they can tell the artist has a bright career ahead of them.

NFTs cant be limited as you suggest because they dont have a specific use. Saying they should be limited to big companies is like saying it should be illegal to resell an autographed baseball card. There are many types of NFTs including art, memberships, tickets, legal contracts, transferrable asset baskets and more.

Scammers are despicable but everywhere on earth theres an opportunity to make money, scammers will appear. Theres scammers in every economy. Artists and collectors report scams to platforms as soon as they find them. Its hard to keep up at this point. 

In my opinion, NFTs themselves arent the problem -- they're merely a technology for owning, transferring and selling an item's digital representation. The problem is that scammers are running rampant to the point that its really detrimentally affected the NFT art market and shifted everyones attention towards these generated collections. Caveat emptor, people should never believe promises of riches based on buying an NFT. Buying expecting to make a profit is gambling. 

I only buy artwork NFTs from artists whose work I really like I can tell are going to keep working. I build personal relationships with the people I buy from and the collectors I sell my own work to. People should do this more and gamble with cartoons less! ü§£",426,i2cjklk,t1_i27s47g,/r/AskReddit/comments/tnkzd9/antinft_redditors_what_would_have_to_change_about/i2cjklk/,1,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,,

I told him that we can't rely on NFT or crypto money as income. We need to budget according to our income from our regular jobs. I thought he listened to me and trusted him when he presented me with a budget and plan to buy a nice house only using his NFT money as a down payment. A few months in and I realized that he fudged the numbers on that budget. He was planning on using NFT/crypto but knew I wouldn't agree. Now it seems the bubble has popped and we're losing money every month. I've come up with a solution to get us out of this but there's a divorce along with it.

Companies will be able to sell nfts and pay out dividends to holders if they choose. Artists will be able to drop exclusive releases to holders, give them access to secret shows, and reward holders for being supportive. There is so many use cases for nfts in the future.

Its so cringey to see people buy clout and then act like they earned it. Probably the worst thing about NFTs in my opinion. I've been to some big NFT conferences and man let me tell you, the ego that those ape owners have from buying an overpriced cartoon makes me wanna barf. 

to make matters worse, the actual artists are having a tough time making ends meet because all the ""investors"" buy into these scams now for some reason. Artist single-editions are not selling as well as they did a year ago, before the apes launched.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding the ""universally free"" aspect, theres an interesting movement of NFT projects embracing Creative Commons CC0 licensing. So you're buying an nft with art you explicitly dont have any exclusive rights to. I suppose really you're buying community membership. I'm all about CC0 and interested to see how this progresses.

Reddit_Comments,190bpm,"This is a pretty inaccurate explanation. I'll respond one sentence at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The picture just represents the NFT.

Correct, the NFT is not a picture. It is an irrevocable digital token which links to metadata which points to a url containing a picture.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The NFT itself is just a bit of data on a server.

The NFT itself is actually on the blockchain, which is a network of servers around the world. It will never exist only on a single server. However you're partially right in a technical sense -- most people think of NFTs as the image, whereas its just a link to metadata. That metadata is usually hosted on a server. So is the image. Smart creators put these on IPFS which ensures that the data will remain available even if the original content server goes down. BUT most major NFT platforms put their metadata and images on centralized servers, completely negating the entire purpose of the NFT, and leaving the use at risk of having NFTs with images that will disappear someday.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You buy the ability to stand at a place in a line, and you get to look at the picture from where you're standing.

I dont know where to being with this, its just some weird made up thing you said

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Its literally nothing.

Sometimes this is true. People buy the image, but given the centralized server issue i mentioned, that can be removed. So yeah, some people have bought soemthing which turned out to be nothing. There are a lot of scams, probably 99% of the nfts created this year are scams.",262,i225cx9,t1_i223lzc,/r/AskReddit/comments/tnkzd9/antinft_redditors_what_would_have_to_change_about/i225cx9/,1,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,,

There could be lots of services like renting items, trading through tons of different types of services. Selling an item even if you're banned from the game or unable to actually get on.

The best example of ""The Emperor‚Äôs New Clothes"" I have ever seen.

The other complete bullshit thing for me is cryptocurrency.

Virtually every one of the hundreds of ""coins"" that can be purchased by the public, has either lost a substantial amount of it‚Äôs value, or is a complete rug-pull fraud scam.  These privately issued cryptocurrencies are not backed by a governmental body (like Euros, US and Ca dollars, British pounds, etc.) and their founders mostly use pump and dump schemes, to deplete the coin fund of its entire value.  

Moon Coin was only valued at a million dollars at its highest, until the founder, a You Tuber called Tech Lead took out nevery cent.  He is facing federal criminal charges.  Doge Coin is worth less than five per cent of what most buyers paid for it.  Even BitCoin, the most widely known cryptocurrency, has lost a huge portion of its worth.",221,i1spwen,t3_tkooac,/r/AskReddit/comments/tkooac/what_does_everyone_seem_to_accept_but_you_think/i1spwen/,1,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,,

Reddit_Comments,500_Shames,"Functionally, NFTs on the blockchain are just ‚Äúdibs‚Äù that can be transferred and tracked. That‚Äôs all. I can call dibs on the Mona Lisa, I can call dibs on a url that points at a picture of a monkey, and I can call dibs on tweet that someone else made. Everyone can see that I was the first to call divs and that my dibs are unique and special. I can also transfer or sell these dibs to someone else. 

Now, this is honestly really similar to how land ownership works - you have a deed document that says you own this land because you or some original owner called dibs on it in the past. However, that deed is only as valid as the force that will back it up, whether that be the US Government, society agreeing upon and respecting the legitimacy of dibs, or you with a gun.

Some contracts use the tokenUri function to return a json object, including data-URI for the image property, instead of a URL. Fully on-chain art can be very expensive to implement, but is generally highly sought after by knowledgable NFT collectors.

Heres an example of fully on-chain art by a famous crypto-artist named Pak. Go to the contracts tab and read how its implemented!

Yeah, nfts are weird and the technology should really be applied for things better than art reproductions but have you ever seen an expensive reprints of famous photographs or paintings? Mother fuckers wanna charge more that $20 for something that can literally be printed but people still buy them and it's generally accepted as a fine thing to do.





For the people who unintentionally became memes, they honestly deserve the money. Imagine minding your own business and then suddenly a million Middle Class American Facebook Mom's‚Ñ¢ use a picture of you to send around in a way that boils down to mocking because you accidentally did something cringey or they just think you look funny.





Looked at gifs on messenger and one of the first ones was a clearly disabled guy, ultimately minding his own business. Bro, imagine being the face of a gif that people send around to make fun of their friends just because you have a disability and decided to go outside. 





I just shaved off my beard for the first time in years and I don't wanna go outside.

Reddit_Comments,gourley4p,"From Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/):  

An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos....

NFTs are also generally one of a kind, or at least one of a very limited run, and have unique identifying codes. ‚ÄúEssentially, NFTs create digital scarcity,‚Äù says Arry Yu, chair of the Washington Technology Industry Association Cascadia Blockchain Council and managing director of Yellow Umbrella Ventures.

My words:
So, basically, you pay money for ""ownership"" of this one-of-a-kind digital image of a man using Reddit on the toilet, right?  But, really, all you own is a line in a fancy spreadsheet.

Take a look at the Shibarium Network sub that Yoshi created. He even removed himself from that and the sub is dead. It was only a front to sell a lie. You can still see he was the creator of that sub.

Speaking of sub creators. Look at the Shibonk sub. The creator u/Devy10 has even removed himself from that and moved on to pump other shit. He made his money off of you suckers and moved on. Same thing with u/forkincrypto that was the main shiller of the entire thing.
