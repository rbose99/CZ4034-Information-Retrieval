Zaofy,"I can't in CSGO, although there have been more than a few times when people just sold the stuff for irl money. And again: Why use NFTs? If Valve wants to fascilitate the sale of skins for real money without going via Steam Wallet they could already easily do so. Bit of a bit bad example here because Valve also owns Steam, but the same would go for a game like GTA. Nothing is really gained by fascilitating it via an NFT instead of a database entry. If the developer wants to make the item unusable they can easily do that either way.

Depends on the ticket. One of my local cinemas offers a kind of movie pass where I can pay a subscription and watch two movies each month ""for free"". Admittedly that one isn't transferable to another person. But transferable season tickets have been a thing for ages in sports.

Hard_Corsair,"&gt;But the same is true of systems that aren't blockchains. Why do you think it hasn't been done?

&amp;#x200B;

Blockchain allows even more options than non-blockchain, and offloads a fair amount of backend development.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So why would Valve suddenly be interested in allowing NFTs do the same thing, when they could implement NFTs in the ways that suck and retain the same control they have today?

&amp;#x200B;

Valve would probably be the last holdout since they already have an existing marketplace, but the answer for all the other publishers is the opportunity to sell more stuff. They haven't already for 2 key reasons; they're smaller than Valve, and the only way around that would be to collaborate with their competitors. Blockchain platforms make it feasible for each to build their own NFT market without collaboration and have them all be linked together and accessible to a common userbase. It eliminates a need for trust.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;We have that. It's called procedural generation, and it's usually not great. Be honest, nobody is selling this as ""Hey, you know that background shrubbery that was really great in that one area in Oblivion? What if you could have that in Fortnite?""

&amp;#x200B;

Procedural generation is separate; that's when the game takes existing asset components and combines them randomly or semi-randomly. I'm talking about making those pieces from scratch. The best example that comes to mind is Forza Horizon. When Turn 10/Playground Games wants to add a new car, it takes about a year. They take a real car, they scan and analyze it in a bunch of different ways, and then they meticulously recreate a digital version that exhibits all the same characteristics. What I'm proposing is an automation of that process to take it from a year to a week or less. The humans provide the data from the vehicle, and the game converts that into a fully-functional drivable car.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;I'll be honest, a lot of this has been covered by this guy already. Here, let's save ourselves some time:

&amp;#x200B;

The answer to that is taking object-oriented programming as a paradigm to an extreme. Let's look at the Helmet of Nor for a moment; it gives +1 to strength, and it increases red potion drops when killing orcs. What if the definitions for each of those things are built into the helmet itself? So, when you bring the helmet into the noir game, it tells the noir game what strength and orcs and red potions are. It modifies a character attribute that it determines to be closest to strength, like maybe punching damage. It also determines that mafia enforcers fit the description of orcs, and bourbon is similar to a red potion. Or, it can decide that your game doesn't have elements that correspond and the effects do nothing and you determine that it was a poor choice to equip.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Never mind modeling something that's even a little bit appropriate to the theme. Never mind what it'll do to the in-game economy.

&amp;#x200B;

That ship has long since sailed. I'm not sure which game I would say killed it, but most large F2P games have stupid cosmetics that ruin the theme already.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Let's be very clear what you're arguing for here. It's not just AI-minted assets. It's AI designing and building the entire game. If it's a good game, you're assuming actual full-blown AGI.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm arguing for game systems to be embedded into assets that participate in them, and for AI-minted assets. I'm arguing for a future of game development with a lot more brainstorming and a lot less busy work. I'm arguing for a system where half of the work can be done with pen and paper just coming up with ideas, and almost none of it ever involves having to use AutoDesk Maya because Maya sucks.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And if you've got an AGI up your sleeve, I'm exponentially more interested in that than I am in your cryptobro sales pitch.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not pitching shit. I don't own any NFT's, I haven't minted any, and there aren't currently any that I think are worth buying. I just get annoyed when people start foaming at the mouth at any mention of the term. We haven't had a chance to see anything cool be built with it yet, it's a bit early to pass conclusive judgment. Crypto as a whole is still essentially a prototype.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So for practical reasons, the most reasonable solution is to put a server in the way. Have the Steam servers talk to the blockchain. But now we're back to Vlave being able to ban you

&amp;#x200B;

To clarify, games will need centralized servers for gameplay anyway, and I'm not suggesting they'll ever be unable to ban you from playing the game. Rather, I'm hoping for a scenario where Valve bans you from playing the games but can't seize your digital assets, so you can still sell them off and cash out.

&amp;#x200B;

Tech companies having the ability to ban users with no oversight is a big problem that doesn't get talked about enough, especially outside of gaming. As annoying as it is for Valve to seize and shut down your Steam account, it's infinitely worse when Google pulls that shit, and there should probably be regulation put in place, but that's a separate problem.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Not to rub it in, but... there isn't a technical mitigation, because this part isn't a technical problem. Most people want moderation. Otherwise, you get the time-to-penis problem. If there truly is no one central authority stopping me from bringing any NFT I want from any game into yours, then every NFT-enabled game will be overrun with walking penises.

&amp;#x200B;

I would rather the internet and its games revert to more of a wild-west paradigm, personally. I don't view TTP as a  problem. Nonetheless, I want moderation to happen at the level of individual games/modes and not at the platform/market level. It's fine for your game to ban my penis-cannon NFT as long as I can keep it and play less-boring games/modes where I'm allowed to spawn it in.",i2p4raz,t1_i2ou4ov,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2p4raz/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

Hard_Corsair,"&gt;	NFTs have no value in part because they don‚Äôt involve the transfer of any actual ownership in the copyright and they can essentially be reproduced by anyone without limitation unless the copyright holder spends the time and money necessary to protect the copyright.

But that's how basically all media works. If you buy Shrek 2 on DVD, you don't receive any actual ownership or the copyright. You still have people pirating Shrek 2 by torrent. If you pay me $1000 to photograph your wedding you don't own a single photo. If you commission a custom painting you won't own the painting. The creator always retains copyright. That has nothing to do with NFT's unless you somehow mistakenly thought they'd let you completely disregard copyright law. NFT's let you own things, but ""own"" is a very murky term with any media, physical or otherwise.

Essentially, an NFT in the context of artwork is essentially a signature from the creator. It's like buying a book that's been signed by the author; the content is the same but it makes it slightly special. I wouldn't pay large sums of money for a signed book but that doesn't make the concept abominable. But NFT's aren't limited to artwork; they're potentially an extremely broad category. The term itself is easier explained as crypto not-currency. There's a lot of things that aren't currency.

NFT's for gaming in this case can be anything from a cosmetic item like a digital hat to a functional item like a Yu-Gi-Oh card to a proof-of-purchase key that allows you to launch the game.

&gt;	Basically the only value that comes from an nft or a steam marketplace item is in its actual use, not its ownership.

Or the sentiment it generates. People aren't perfectly rational with their purchasing habits and will buy worthless things purely because it amuses them in the moment.

I find it insane that with a name that's as on the nose as ""Bored Ape Yacht Club"" that the whole point is for wealthy morons to burn money for their amusement.

Let's be very clear what you're arguing for here. It's not just AI-minted assets. It's AI *designing and building the entire game.* If it's a good game, you're assuming actual full-blown AGI.

And if you've got an AGI up your sleeve, I'm exponentially more interested in that than I am in your cryptobro sales pitch.

&gt; In theory it would be cool to have blockchain-based games where every single action of every match of every player of the game is recorded, but that's so far away from being possible.

Oh, it's been done, it's just that they're unplayably bad and barely count as games.

&gt; ...DRM can be relegated to blockchain.

I assume you don't actually mean DRM, because DRM is about preventing people from copying data. NFTs don't do that, as anyone who has ever right-clicked on an ape understands.

So maybe you meant using some standard DRM engine like SecuROM, only instead of checking with a central server to see if it's your copy, it checks with the blockchain... directly? Do you realize the sheer volume of bandwidth and storage required for a node on a busy chain?

And that's just to read. But you likely need to *write* somewhere, so that if some other machine turns on with the same copy of the game, it'll log you out. Who's paying the transaction fees on that, if you're writing directly to the chain?

So for practical reasons, the most reasonable solution is to put a server in the way. Have the Steam servers talk to the blockchain. But now we're back to Vlave being able to ban you:

&gt; &gt; If Valve doesn't like you and wants to ban every NFT you own...

&gt; I'm sure there's a way to mitigate that, but it's beyond the scope of what I can brainstorm.

Not to rub it in, but... there isn't a technical mitigation, because this part isn't a technical problem. Most people *want* moderation. Otherwise, you get the [time-to-penis](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/time-to-penis-ttp) problem.

Zaofy,"Someone would still have to implement these into their systems.

So why would Steam for example implement new avatars that can only be purchased over some other marketplace into their platform? If they wanted things to be sellable, they could easily do that already. Same with Fortnite, World of Warcraft, etc.

The only way I could see another plattform implement this is with smart contracts that take a percentage off of every sale. Or if the company banks on getting a large enough windfall from the initial sale (re: Konami and Castlevania). And if they wanted to that they could just use their own database and wouldn't have to ""mint"" them on a specific blockchain.

Maybe I misunderstand NFTs, but as far as I can see it's nothing more than a marketing gimmick and lots of misunderstood tech, like people thinking that you could transfer skins between entirely different games just because you have one as an NFT.

Dirty-Electro,"Prefacing this by saying that I‚Äôm a GME investor.

Full agree. The market is designed to confuse and the lack of transparency is designed to work in favor of those running the system. People can try to make claims about what may happen, but at the end of the day, the integrity of the data that‚Äôs being utilized cannot be fully ensured. 

Illegal market manipulation has occurred since long before the large run-up of last January, and continues to occur. Market makers (MMs) operate between the lines of regulation and can take advantage of their privileges to exploit trades. Subjects such as payment for order flow (PFOF), spoofing and naked shorting come to mind. 

There‚Äôs no telling when regulatory enforcement will come, but the ongoing DOJ investigation is likely gathering evidence as this is being discussed. The DOJ has a history of collapsing large-scale market schemes,
most notably Bernie Madoff‚Äôs.

Back to the market makers and short hedge funds (SHFs): their goal is to never close out short positions. They have their ways to misreport and manipulate. They try to do this on all ends possible - they even employ bots on social media platforms to sow discord and try to discourage any new investors from accessing the data. 

Their comments and posts all follow a general script. In short, they‚Äôll say that the GME investors are cultish the shorts‚Äô positions were closed in January. First off, I don‚Äôt disagree that GME investors (specifically from SuperStonk) can seem cultish at times. There‚Äôs weird and cringey stuff that happens in the subreddits sometimes. But, when informed arguments are offered along with public data (which is, once again, not fully reliable), one can at least critically evaluate the source(s) to reach their own conclusions.

With that being said, the only evidence we have that shorts somehow closed in January is a dip in self-reported short interest and a drop in price. Smaller short sellers may have covered, including Melvin Capital. But they didn‚Äôt have the largest short position against GME.

Anyways, the due diligence (DD) offered within many of the GME subreddits utilizes publicly reported data. Like I mentioned earlier, we can‚Äôt know for sure whether we can trust the public data.

Short-squeeze/MOASS stuff aside, GameStop has utilized the influx of capital and renewed investor interest to accelerate into e-commerce and, soon, NFTs. There‚Äôs no telling how adaptable NFTs within the gaming industry will be; but OpenSea, the current largest NFT marketplace, has a $13.3B valuation/market cap. If adoption becomes widespread, GameStop‚Äôs marketplace valuation could be incredibly high. GameStop‚Äôs current market cap of $13.7B makes the prospect of this marketplace, as an investor, even more exciting.

GameStop also has Ryan Cohen at the helm of the change - under his leadership as Chairman, GameStop has poached a *lot* of employees from big tech: Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and more. This NFT marketplace in the works that he‚Äôs spearheading ‚Äì I believe it‚Äôll be big. Oh, and one more thing, Ryan Cohen has tweeted about short sellers and how much they suck. He definitely knows something that investors may not. 

With all of that being said, I understand the skepticism that an outside observer may have towards the online communities for GME. I share that same kind of caution towards all of the info I come across.

JaCraig,"&gt;That‚Äôs the great part! The 10 copies of the game will be sold endlessly, until the end of the internet, back and forth between collectors or new players, for whatever the market decides is the right price, giving commission to the developer for every sale.

That really doesn't work in the industry. There is really no way to make enough hype to get long term sales. Having a long tail for a dev is one of those things you wish for but it's rare. Usually up front sales and drop off for AAA or nothing and maybe a bump if you're a lucky indie. Long tail is rare and you're more likely to just fold. For example there was a game that came out where you could only really play it once. You were either in the crowd or streaming/playing it. They were banking on Twitch carrying them along with word of mouth and it didn't work. And I wish I could find the name of it because they did an interesting write up a while back. The issue was 100% marketing and keeping the buzz going post launch. Conversely you have Among Us where it was a failure at first until one person streamed it and it blew up. If there was some weird arbitrary limit in place on game sales, it would have just stayed dead.

Anyway, I'm not saying the tech has no value. Like I said, I've built stuff using block chain, etc. It has uses and:

&gt; (or skins, right? Why would you buy the $20 weapon skin if a freelancer made one for $5 that‚Äôs just as good)

This is the kind of thing that I see some possibility of it getting used for. That said outside of platforms like Roblox, it's going to be a hard sell. NFT, at its core, is just a pointer and not the actual product. So anyone that wants to do what you suggest, whether using NFT or not, would need to build out infrastructure to allow the trading, hosting of the skin or model or whatever, and devs would need to make it work in their game. Average game dev studio doesn't have the bandwidth to make that work. So that leaves something like mod sales similar to Steam, something like Roblox, or dev tool makers like Unity (note that the SaaS space for dev tools is potentially large but even here it's a weird use case that I've seen pop up). It's not the best tech to use for these companies but it's viable.

And going back to the original comment that I made with regard to GameStop, I don't see GameStop having an in on this front and it's the only one that I see as a possible use for the tech from their standpoint. It would take a lot of partnering and they'd be completely shut out from Steam and Epic as neither want to touch the tech currently. GameStop no longer seems to want to work as a publisher seeing as GameTrust seems to be dead which is sad because Song of the Deep was a good title. I would have liked to see them work on this front more. Anyway, that means they're going to partner with whom for in game products? Or for that matter, resale of whole games. I don't see a store front partnering here. if we were talking Sony or MS and they wanted an NFT like resale market then sure. Viable. They have direct access to the back end of their product and could make it so title A can be moved from user X to user Y. No problem. That's not an option for a third party though unless MS, Sony, or Nintendo allow it. I don't see how GameStop makes that jump with the current barriers in place. Even with their sales partnership with MS, I don't see this option opening up to them in the near to mid future without legislative changes. So that leaves a huge question mark on what the heck they plan to do with the platform. I'll wait to hear what they actually announce but I can't picture a viable product beyond something microtransaction related.

Also I agree on the Twitter front. I don't like it. But I picked Mike Bithell because he's an indie who owns a small dev studio. He is definitely opinionated on the subject on the current wave of NFTs in games.

jakdaniels22,"Correct.  If NFTs are to be used in a game then those will be minted(created) by the developers.  So if the developers or publisher do not want NFTs in their game they can make that choice and likely some will do so.

However if they do chose to mint NFTs for their game then depending on the marketplace it is possible that they can receive a percentage of each time it is sold.  The NFT can be skins or even the digital copy of the game itself.  I imagine that to encourage adoption of NFTs into games that an NFT Marketplace like what GameStop is planning would give the developer/publisher a cut of sales but we do not know yet what it will look like for certain.  This can be a win/win with gamers getting ownership of their purchases and developers/publishers getting continued revenue from each sale and resale of their NFTs.

NFTs can replace microtransactions but then you will have true ownership of those assets and can resell them which means they will still have value after you purchase.  So I do not see huge changes to the type of NFTs/microtransaction we will see in games when they are first introduced.

I image developers testing gamers reception to NFTs with new IPs before trying to introduce them to existing IPs risking backlash.

CreativeGPX,"&gt;  A paper contract isn't the same, it can be destroyed, faked, copied etc much more easily than Blockchain.

Sure if you consider the most poorly made paper contract with the most idealistically run NFT. But in reality, the means to protect a paper contract are pretty trivial and have existed for a long time. It doesn't have to be a realistic concern that a contract will be destroyed, faked, copied, etc.

Also, these all have parallels with NFTs. A ""faked"" contract is the same thing as a ""faked"" NFT. You cannot on the blockchain verify that off the blockchain all the proper checks of the people, laws and property were don't, so you're still relying on the same central authorities to do that as if you weren't on the blockchain. Additionally, protecting digital keys is something that is much harder for the average person to do than securing a physical contract. NFTs can be irreversibly stolen if a person gets a virus, falls for a phishing scam, has their key compromised, loses their key, etc. You say that a contract can be lost, but so can a key. The made difference is that problems on the blockchain are, by design, extremely difficult to resolve. Problems not on the blockchain have lots of established methods of resolution.

&gt; Why wouldn't courts help you if you had proof of ownership via recorded history on a Blockchain rather than, say, on paper?

I didn't say they wouldn't help you. I said best case scenario, you'd still ultimately be relying on the courts so it's not an improvement to go on the blockchain.

However, in practice, it might not be valid. If you're not calling a lawyer every time you do an NFT transaction, confirming they the person selling the NFT even has the rights to the thing the NFT mentions, identifying without a doubt who they are in case of fraud, etc., then legally it's a lot riskier. And most proponents of NFTs are touting specifically how it's a feature that you no longer have to interact with all of the institutions that do those things.

The people behind Ethereum wanted a distributed, trustless, immutable ledger of basically everything, from financial transactions to contracts to medical records. The idea of putting all this personal information in one place, let alone a publicly-visible, trustless environment, is so amazingly bad that it's almost impressive.

Even the lauded ""smart contract"" functionality of NFTs is far less impressive than advocates would like to pretend. 

Every transaction other than reading data off the chain is a transaction that must be verified, and that takes time, energy, and money. 

Individual tokens are tiny, able to hold maybe a few dozen lines of code, and trying to build anything complicated enough to be worth calling a program means you're eating into that limited space even more just because you have to make each chunk of code connect to every other chunk. 

To debug a program, you can't just edit a token; they're basically immutable once minted. Instead, you have to mint a bunch of new tokens and jump through hoops to fix all the references that are pointing to the bugged parts so they instead point to the fixed versions, and every step of that process costs money and takes ages while you wait for all the transactions to be validated.

ampers_and_,"Hello,

The potential of NFTs beyond their current awful status is pretty astounding.

Right now, through glimpses of the data I reviewed coming from the API of GameStop's NFT Marketplace, I see some in-game skins that are being developed. The idea is that through making them non-fungible tokens (NFTs), users will be able to resell the skins or upload them to other games/media that have systems that can access the Blockchain.

This gives companies the opportunity to also return a percentage of the resale where they wouldn't have otherwise when people stop playing their game, or a small fee to transfer the skin to another game.

There is also ideas surrounding the online game resale/transfer system which would allow people who purchase games online to sell them back for most (maybe 90%?) their money, but netting the marketplace and publisher a percentage (5% each?). Currently when you buy a game online, it stays on your account forever.

There is other use cases as well, like trying a NFT to a physical product which could be used for tracking and to make sure you're getting the original product you purchased (could combat the fake products we see flood the market like with Amazon). Or to help prevent people who buy all of a product on release and then resell it for higher prices to people who really want one (like with PS and Xbox).

Overall, the goal of the marketplace as it stands is to be both a central hub for other NFT marketplaces to connect to and trade through (whether it's art NFTs or NFTs connected to video games) as well as a online NFT retailer itself (where people can sell their own art NFT or apply to sell their video game NFT content in collections as well).

I think if it is done properly, can put a lot of ownership back into the consumer. I want to be able to resell my 50 Steam games that I haven't touched in 5 years. I want to actually own a in-game skin and maybe make some money back if I decide to stop playing League or other games. And ultimately, it could be beneficial for publishers and game companies to incorporate it into their system as they would make a percentage off of it.",i2m5syp,t1_i2kpppx,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2m5syp/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

Hard_Corsair,"&gt;NFTs can absolutely be restricted by the company that launched them -- this can be written into the original smart contract even on a more common chain, and you can of course start your own chain. And both kinds can also give a slice of the pie to the company that launches them, either because it's written into the contract, or because that company controls the entire chain they run on.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course they can be implemented in ways that suck. Everybody is already on that page. They're ignoring that it can also be implemented in ways that are awesome.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The ""cross-platform"" part can be done just as easily with traditional databases as with NFTs. There's these things called APIs, maybe you've heard of them.

&amp;#x200B;

By cross-platform in this case, I mean for multi-platform games. Imagine if I'm a publisher and I want to release my new game *Murdertrucks* on Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation. I want to sell players cometic skins for the wheels of their playable vehicles, and to let players resell them amongst each other. I can't use Steam Marketplace regardless of API's. I can use it for the PC version, but Steam isn't about to let console players buy/earn skins on consoles and then list them for sale on Steam. With NFT's, it doesn't matter where you're playing my game; you can buy and trade the same items regardless of your hardware choice.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Which is to say: Not easily at all. If you thought this would mean you could buy a CS:GO weapon and bring it over to Fortnite or whatever, that would take a fuckton of effort on the part of Epic to support each CS weapon, all to introduce a direct competitor for the shit they already sell you in Fortnite, so why on earth would they bother?

&amp;#x200B;

I did mention that on another comment thread, and that's a much more hypothetical case than what I'm proposing here, but let's talk about that for a second. The future of game development has to be automated AI-based asset creation. Right now it takes way too much time and effort and cost to make a production asset, like a shrubbery. There's a bunch of steps from modeling and texturing to rigging and animating to setting it's interactive properties. As assets get more and more complex they cause game development costs to balloon, which is already happening. The only way forward is to make an engine that automates most of that, so games can go back to being made by 50 people rather than 500. In the future, one person takes a short video of a shrubbery, and an algorithm does all of the work to turn it into a usable asset. Then, the developers are free to start sticking it into their maps. When this happens, assets can be instantly ported from game to game even built on completely separate engines, as the resident algorithm translates them for use.

&amp;#x200B;

This is inevitable, and has nothing to do with NFT's. It's the only way to prevent the games industry from collapsing as production costs keep rising. The result though is that once the tech is in place, it won't take any work to add CS:GO weapons to Fortnite; Fortnite can do it all on its own.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Let me stop you before you suggest games that run entirely on-chain without a central server. Those exist, and they are both spectacularly expensive in both money and CO2, and so limited and low-res they make Game'n'Watch look good.

&amp;#x200B;

No, of course not. I expect that item inventory and DRM can be relegated to blockchain.

&amp;#x200B;

In theory it would be cool to have blockchain-based games where every single action of every match of every player of the game is recorded, but that's so far away from being possible.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Same applies to the ""no bans"" part, by the way. If Valve doesn't like you and wants to ban every NFT you own from their games, they can do that easily, because they still control the games themselves. At which point, have fun selling a ""digital good"" that you can't actually use in the same marketplace as other people are selling goods that can be used.

it seems like you know somewhat the subject, but only the way it was told to sell the idea.

NFT, or non fungible TOKEN, are, as the acronym says, a token, so a link, some random data but not a lot of it.

in the case of videogames, as the company can still crash into oblivion or say that you cant sell things anymore (or just delete your things) , the actual data still being in their servers, there is no benefit to make such market place use NFTs. If you want to see a successful marketplace that use real money, just go and see the CS GO skins and lootbox.

one of the useful ways to use NFTs would be, for exemple, the stock market, with a public database of who own what shares, so that it would be imposible to deny that you owned a stock. As it doesnt need any more data that what could be in the actual NFT, it would be as impermeable as the blockchain (since, Well, it uses it)

SanityInAnarchy,"Except absolutely none of those things are any more true of NFTs than they are of Steam Marketplace. Adding NFTs doesn't actually solve any of this.

NFTs can absolutely be restricted by the company that launched them -- this can be written into the original smart contract even on a more common chain, and you can of course start your own chain. And both kinds can also give a slice of the pie to the company that launches them, either because it's written into the contract, or because that company controls the entire chain they run on.

The ""cross-platform"" part can be done just as easily with traditional databases as with NFTs. There's these things called APIs, maybe you've heard of them.

Which is to say: Not easily at all. If you thought this would mean you could buy a CS:GO weapon and bring it over to Fortnite or whatever, that would take a fuckton of effort on the part of Epic to support *each* CS weapon, all to introduce a direct competitor for the shit they already sell you in Fortnite, so why on earth would they bother?

And if they don't bother, the only ""cross-platform"" part is that you get a digital receipt that says you own that gun, so that if Valve or CS:GO ever goes away, you can still trade the receipt you have to an asset you can't actually use in any real game anymore. It's like speculating on the value of a ticket for the coat check in a hotel that's burned down.

Same applies to the ""no bans"" part, by the way. If Valve doesn't like you and wants to ban every NFT you own from their games, they can do that easily, because they still control the games themselves. At which point, have fun selling a ""digital good"" that you can't actually use in the same marketplace as other people are selling goods that *can* be used.

thebaron2,"I'm not certain that artists do love NFTs, although I'm sure they love selling anything they can!

In all seriousness, though, I'm not sure the comparison is apt. Right now publishers control the digital marketplace. There is no second hand market, so if a game is launched digitally then you have to pay full price, wait for the publisher to run a promotion, or forego buying the game.

From a publisher POV, IMO that seems like a nice arrangement because the publisher holds all of the cards. There is no way to legally acquire the software outside of the ecosystem that the publisher has set up. And it seems to me that there's a reason this market hasn't been developed. You don't need NFT to establish a resale market on a platform like Steam, for example. You just need the will to do it and the legal rights.

And that's part of the problem, I think. Those legal rights exist explicitly with physical media but they do not exist with digital media. There's something called the ""First Sale Doctrine"" and reselling digital songs, for example, has been litigated and companies that tried to set up resale marketplaces were forced to shut down.

So it seems like there is a LOT to be worked out here, and it's surprising to me that if some of these details *have* been hashed out that we haven't heard of any partnerships or anything in this regard.

Time will tell, but I would bet that in 3 years we do not have a digital, second-hand marketplace based on NFT technology.

There aren't currently (that I know of) any marketplaces that do 2nd hand digital goods. However, I believe there is a market for it. For example, the recent legal kerfuffle Bruce Willis got into trying to ""gift"" his Apple Music library to his kids? Or the semi-regular news stories of gaming accounts being hacked and people ""stealing"" ""valuable"" gear. The biggest reason I would assume is due to how difficult it is to set-up something like that, with one of the largest headaches being ""how actually owns the content?"".

I used Steam as an example because it's the most well-known digital distribution platform I can think of. However, I'm not so sure that the team at Valve have even asked the question.

It all depends on the publisher in question. There are pros and cons of adopting new technologies.

Even without the tech, the second-hand game market would still exist. It makes sense to try and grab a slice of that pie.

CreativeGPX,"Basically. Which is why as /u/PhoebusQ47 says, it's not a required or good way to do it.

1. A paper contract can specify/limit the terms of alteration and can be publicly available. So, NFTs aren't unique in offering these.
2. These two features often aren't desirable. Many people rightly value their privacy with respect to their possessions and contracts. Also, many people rightly value that contracts can be acted upon through other means. For example, the courts can help you transfer property in the case of inheritance or theft, while the blockchain cannot.
3. Both traditional contracts and NFTs are useless on their own because anybody can just ignore them. What gives them teeth is the body that enforces them. Traditional contracts are enforced by court systems and law enforcement. NFTs don't seem to offer anything beyond that in terms of ensuring that the contract is carried out, but in some cases might offer less.
4. The blockchain is (especially presently) an extremely inefficient and expensive way to operate by design.
5. While ""trust"" is in theory helped by the blockchain, that's not really a guarantee. The blockchain is controlled by anonymous miners proportionately to their resources. In other words, it still might be controlled by enormous corporate or government interests at any point. While we don't necessarily trust corporations in general, non-blockchain solutions at least offer a name, face and legal entity so that we can make informed judgements about trust or even hold the entity accountable legally or otherwise.",i2kpvcb,t1_i2k4h6b,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2kpvcb/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

NFTs are an inherently exploitative scam stapled onto an already exploitative scam pushed by extremely wealthy tech moguls and corporations that exploit the gullibility of the millions of people who are blinded by techy buzzwords they don't understand to join into a pyramid scheme that more resembles technological astrology than it does an actual advancement in tech. You aren't investing in a system that helps the working class, you're fetishizing something that will help stomp on them further. At least when MTX became a thing in video games most people didn't worship them like they were fucking sacred.

The entire system is a pyramid scheme with no actual ethics or morals behind it being peddled to separate gullible people like you from more of your hard-earned money because of some promise that you'll be one of the ones who got in early enough and got lucky enough to get mega rich because a tech bro living in a 35 million dollar house in Santa Clarita spams Twitter forty times an hour trying to encourage anyone listening to them to join their fraud while masturbating over their completely false self-image of being low class rags to riches wealth out to help the little guy against the corporate overlords. Almost all of these men got unfathomably wealthy in the .Com Boom or in the early 2000s social media explosion and none of the dessicated ghouls who peddle this shit care about you or your financial well-being.

Castriff,"&gt;How is it reinventing the wheel though? Does GameStop currently have this exact sort of system? 

I'm saying NFTs in general are reinventing the wheel when it comes to transferring game assets. There's no legitimate reason to use NFTs rather than copying the basic principles of systems that came before. It's not even ""easier to develop"" as you claim; they might borrow the framework from an existing cryptocurrency but decentralized systems take way more work to implement and maintain than a peer-to-server protocol. 

&gt; What I won't stand for is hatred of technology because it's popular to.

NFTs aren't hated because it's popular to hate on them. It's popular to hate on them because they deserve to be hated for a myriad of reasons. I haven't even scratched the surface. 

&gt;As for environmental aspects, we don't place the same kind of hate on fossil fuel transportation as we do NFTs. Yes, we can reduce this by moving to electric vehicles but we can also do so for blockchain by using proof of stake algorithms. 

What I've found is that there are less people overall who use cryptocurrency, by multiple orders of magnitude, but as a percentage of worldwide emissions cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherium [are still outputting more than several European countries](https://digiconomist.net/ethereum-energy-consumption). You're right that electric vehicles can mitigate environmental impact, but mitigating or offsetting an individual's use of cryptocurrency doesn't have the same effect. Everyone who uses cryptocurrency *at all* has to have a full copy of the ledger and update it at the same frequency as everyone else. It's like turning on every car on Earth for the duration of your trip to the grocery store. And just in general, I think it'd be easier to do away with cryptocurrency than it would be to do away with cars.

&gt; Most takes on hating blockchain are directed by people that don't have the understanding or have not done the proper research. 

I'm just going to ask you to trust me that I have. It's not like it's hard to do so. And if you want sources I can provide them.

&gt; Yet I'll take the flak here for pointing this out, even though I'm not advocating for it AT ALL.

You are though, at least a little. You treat this as being inevitable when there's no reason it should be. You have to understand, this is one of those situations where *everything* about the subject needs to be under scrutiny, because the alternative is that people will spread misinformation faster than the truth.

metallice,"None of this is true. With an NFT you have nothing more than the keys to a receipt stored on a blockchain. A receipt that at most does little more than point to a URL or some arbitrary number that someone else has to say means anything.

You having a receipt that you bought music means nothing. If it's for mp3s that receipt stops nobody from copying it. For copy protected tracks or streams the access to that music is still entirely up to the right holder or supplier of that stream. They decide whether you have access based on your NFT and can revoke it at any time. Oh you sold your NFT pointing to a URL to someone else and they didn't like it? Oops well the web host / rights holder decided they don't like that and just made the link useless. You and your blockchain key are powerless. At that point you may as well use a much faster and more efficient standard database.

This applies to all of the things you listed. NONE of these things are actually stored on a blockchain (and couldn't be) meaning they are nothing more than an inefficient receipt that someone else decides matters or not. Which means they might as well host the database themselves... which is what they already do. There is zero benefit to NFTs. If game companies wanted to make cosmetics and items that work between games they already can... With a database. Putting it on a blockchain does nothing.

CaptainChains,"Often when you buy a digital product you don‚Äôt ‚Äúown‚Äù it, you‚Äôre simply buying a license that allows you to use it.

NFTs can be traded so these games that are sitting in libraries can then be sold or traded.

An NFT platform that allows this kind of trading would/will revolutionise the second hand game market. 

You can apply this principle to loads of other digital goods like iTunes, Fortnite skins, online memberships, and whatever else you can think of.

On top of that you can apply ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù to NFTs that give additional functionality to the digital good. A ‚Äúsmart contract‚Äù is just a function that triggers when certain conditions are met. An example that‚Äôs often talked about is artist royalties being paid whenever anyone buys an NFT of their work.

Toby_O_Notoby,"Yeah, but it's not like you think about some weird memeable art piece or something. Basically NFTs stands for ""Non Fungible Tokens"" and means you own a piece of digital property on a blockchain. 

For example that's closer to what Gamestop is trying to do, the band Kings of Leon released 25 NFT tickets that grant you access to any and every concert they might have as well as backstage passes and other such goodies. So there are 25 people in the world who have this exclusive access. But if at any time they want to sell it they can post it on the blockchain and the highest bidder wins. 

What GME is proposing is letting you own an NFT within a game. So they could release a skin on, say, Fortnite where there are only 100 of them in existence. You now own this skin and if you ever want to sell it you can. So instead of spending a couple of bucks on a skin where you will never see your money again, GME creates a marketplace where you can treat the skin like an investment where you can sell it off when you no longer want it.",i2k0v1l,t1_i2jyhes,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/tqw0lh/whats_going_on_with_the_gme_stock_going_up_again/i2k0v1l/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

Other tweets aren't really supporting of the project, or the idea of NFTs in general as far as I can find.

Wendy's Twitter is known for 'roasts' of others and has its hits and misses, and is fairly plugged in on internet and meme culture.

StaticS1gnal,"A translation for the 'whitelist' bit:

NFTs are essentially a speculative stock market, or a multi-level marketing (ponzi) scheme. All the money is made by obtaining the NFT(s) for a low price and reselling at a higher one. So being able to get a free or cheap NFT and reselling to someone else at a higher price is the game and the goal.

Whitelisting is a guaranteed opportunity to 'mint' an NFT. To purchase it as 'new'. Meaning you are the first buyer, and don't have the costs associated with each person who held it before you selling it for higher prices to the next buyer.  The further down the chain of sales the NFT is (the more times its been sold), the more the person holding it wants to sell it for in order to recoup their costs and to make money. 

Additionally, Each time an NFT is minted, it typically has a processing fee (often referred to as 'gas money' by the community).  With NFTs, multiple people may try to mint (buy) at the same time, and the minted NFT goes to the highest bidder. The higher bid is paid in the form OG 'gas money', or these processing fees. Whitelisting avoids the bidding war of processing fees (called a gas war) by guaranteeing you get first dibs and set price.

In short, you're getting in on the ground floor of a ponzi scheme. Be one of the first buyers, face minimal competition to secure your buy, and then hope you can find someone that'll buy from you at a higher price.

Bear in mind with all of this that the goal of the NFT holder is to dupe someone else into buying their NFT for a bigger price than what they paid. So, if they say they are selling to you for a fair price, or that you are 'getting in on the ground floor' of their scheme.... They may be saying whatever it takes to get you to buy.",hzvr7wi,t1_hztdnf5,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/t9a5sr/whats_the_deal_with_people_tweeting_help_wendy/hzvr7wi/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

geckogloves89,"Answer: Twitter users who get a reply from the Wendy's Twitter account get an NFT whitelist. I'm not very well versed in the crypto world so I'm going to let Google explain this:

WarrenPuff_It,"The wastefulness of that market is only a fraction of the hate, I'd say most of it comes from the utter stupidity of the concept and the snide attitudes that NFT peddlers have towards how non-NFT users reaction to their outlandish claims.

I'm not saying blockchain or smart contracts or NFTs are useless, there is a real utility to that sort of network and undoubtedly will be used in a variety of scenarios in the future. But the whole notion of owning some digital ""original"" is flawed from the onset and shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how digital systems work in the first place. 

First, in its most barest sense digital media is a bunch if 1s and 0s that processors translate into interactive information through some sort of interface. Digital media is also meant to be shared, and in order to access it, that media has to be hosted somewhere, and that host server has to connect to a network which means breaking that string of 1s and 0s down into smaller chunks and then smashing them through wires with little post-it notes attached to them so that computers on the other end can reassemble them and let other people interact with the information somehow. There is no ""original"" media there, in the same sense as owning a famous painting or the first cut of a classic film. If your computer was the platform the image was first created on, that image exists as a series of saved files/versions, even if you only saved it as a single file, because your computer keeps a log of multiple versions/save points as well as any backups you might keep. Every time you click on the image or move it to a new folder, you are cutting up the file and reassembling it somewhere else. Which one is authentic in that case? Add to that the nature of how digital media is stored. In order to create the NFT you need to host the image or video in a server. When you go to market and sell the token, that host url is visible to anyone who clicks ""inspect element"" which means they can go straight to the image file and download it for free. Their downloaded imagine is about as authentic as any other version of the same file. 

As well, because it's hosted on a server somewhere, it exists in multiple versions and backups, meaning there is no one single imagine nor some master copy, the more times an image is moved or updated or backed up, the more copies of it are created. How valuable would the Mona Lisa be if there were a myriad versions of it existing in thousands of places all at once? You'd be laughed at for trying to argue with someone about the value of a painting that is replicated 10000x, but with NFTs some people think theirs is special because they have a digital ticket they paid money for.
 

Add to that the smug attitude NFT purchasers seem have in general, in social media circles acting like they somehow own something incredibly valuable and rare, I have encountered quite a few people online who legitimately think their profile picture is ""worth more than your bank account"" which is just opening the door to people right clicking their jpeg.

HotCupofChocolate,"There is hate from many sides.

First, it seems like everyone and their mother want to jump into nfts to make a quick buck, sometimes in a distasteful manner.

For example, the official Twitter account of the late Stan Lee was used to advertise nfts, as was the account of Bob Ross, not to mention many other big corporations.

Gamers hate them for various reasons. 

For example, some videogame studios have advocated for integration of nfts into games in what many gamers see as another tactic to shove useless micro transactions into games to make more money.

Also because transactions on the block chain need quite some computing power, it has caused many PC components to become scarce or more difficult to obtain, which was already difficult due to scalpers and the chip shortage. 

The art community also hates them. 

Art theft is rampant among nfts. Like you could be a small artist posting your art on the web and the next week find out that someone took your art, applied some basic filter and uploaded it to the marketplace to be sold (this happened to Simon Stalenhag, one of my favorite artists).

In some of the worst cases, they even profit from dead people. There was an artist that suffered from a terminal condition, something they reflected in their art, that eventually passed away, and their art was later used for nfts after someone impersonated them. There was also nfts based on Etika and George Floyd. 

Not to mention that in general nft art is seen as ugly (because it escentially has to be mass produced) and not worth the exorbitant prices tag they come with.

yublie,"I think the biggest sources of hate are:

* NFTs are built on top of cryptocurrencies, which are attempts to create ""decentralized"" currencies that are controlled by a collection of private companies and individuals instead of a government. Due to some poor design choices, the most popular cryptocurrencies incentivize people to have lots of computers running pointless calculations, to the point where the overall energy use of cryptocurrency has become very large (comparable to a small-ish country), despite the fact that cryptocurrencies aren't even used that widely and arguably don't serve much of a purpose at all.

* The cryptocurrency industry has already seen several significant speculative bubbles, in which people ""invest"" in assets in the belief that their price will ""go to the moon"", and NFTs are the latest of these. Lots of people have bought into the hype and have invested all of their savings into them, while lots of people are intentionally driving up the hype and profiting from people's greed and naivety. A very simple and common way that they do this is by ""wash trading"" - they create an NFT and trade it backwards and forwards between their own accounts for high prices while using social media to hype it up, creating the illusion that it is considered very valuable. They then sell it to a sucker who has seen the price going up and up and thinks they can make a profit. Then they disappear from the market and suddenly there is no interest in the NFT any more, and the sucker can't sell it.

* The most obvious incarnation of NFTs is those extremely ugly ape profile pictures.",hxx3ugq,t1_hxwpiae,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sy8pzm/whats_going_on_with_the_hate_for_nfts_and_people/hxx3ugq/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

If people want to gamble, fine, but at this point the only money left is table scraps and any greater idealized vision for either is undone by the spectators: crypto will never be viable so long as the only people buying into it are doing so for investment purposes to cash out for other currencies, and NFTs are basically an artificial market for crypto to buy but as an artificial capital to justify a token economy: on a good day they're casino chips.",hxwxh2k,t1_hxwpiae,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sy8pzm/whats_going_on_with_the_hate_for_nfts_and_people/hxwxh2k/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,
44no44,"The documentary can put things in perspective better than any brief summary you'll find here, but to paraphrase a few of the easy points:

* NFTs are built off of blockchain technology, which (to vastly oversimplify) is a sort of decentralized database software that stores data redundantly across a vast network of random people's computers. The blockchain verifies the authenticity of a given transaction by updating it across as much of the database as possible. This has the roundabout side-effect that the system gets less and less efficient as it expands. The more popular a blockchain becomes, the more disproportionate, wasted electricity has to be burned updating it - exponentially moreso than a regular centralized database. Cryptocurrencies are even worse for this than NFTs, but the problem is still there. Many people worry about the environmental cost that will come from widespread adoption of such inefficient technology.

* NFTs are an unregulated market, with all the problems that brings.  The art market was already rife with money laundering and NFTs just make that even easier. Since there's very little restrictions on minting a new NFT, there's nothing stopping people from turning other artists' work into NFTs to be sold without their permission. Since an NFT can be *any* packet of data, not just images, hackers can create bite-sized malware, package it as an NFT, and put it straight into people's wallets to steal everything they have. Et cetera.

* NFT supporters aggressively reproduce like some loud and annoying virus. Naturally, since it's strictly a zero-sum market, anyone who buys an NFT can only ever see returns on that purchase by swindling someone else into buying it from them later for an even higher price. The system gives buyers an incentive to plague the internet with as much misleading overhyped drivel as possible. You don't spend ten thousand dollars on an ape jpeg and *not* treat NFTs like the second coming of Christ - that'd be financial suicide. So it's not just especially naive fools buying in at their own expense. Plenty of reasonable people are scammed into it by the sheer volume of aggressive marketing surrounding them. This is the number one reason people on the internet are so hostile towards anyone who brings up NFTs: the entire topic is a parasite. Granting it any semblance of legitimacy, intentional or otherwise, is just adding fuel to the fire. It's a market propped up by hype and hype alone.

Eona_Targaryen,"Answer: (From a layman): As the owner of an NFT you do not own the image in any way, shape, or form. You pay to have your name typed into a specific slot in the database of owners, that slot is assigned the image purely as representation instead of calling it Slot #5823987 or whatever. If the database owner decides to change your linked NFT pic into a photo of their ass, it's their full legal right and you now have a link to a photo of their ass, if they shut down the database, it's their full legal right and you now have a link to nothing.

It's essentially the old ""buy a star"" scam that private companies used to run. No, you are not now the legal overlord of Star 68372 now, the seller never owned Star 68372, nobody is infringing your rights if they do stuff with Star 68372. If you read the fine print you just paid for the privilege of some random person to write down ""Bob owns star 68372"" in their notebook and mail you a certificate.

NFT owners either don't understand what they're actually buying the rights to and falsely believe they own the art (which is why screenshotting NFTs is commonly used to make fun of these people). Or they're hoping to make money by hyping up the value of their NFTs to buyers, often using semi-legal techniques to manipulate item history. Or they're just straight-up using them to launder money from illegal activities. Because so few laws are set up to cover NFTs at this point, they're a battleground for all sorts of shenanigans that would otherwise be illegal or heavily regulated, and have about zero consumer protection.

The last factor that really annoys people about NFTs is their impact on computer hardware availability. The NFT and Cryptocurrency markets kinda go hand-in-hand, and both require a lot of people to contribute computing power to keep running. Combined with the pandemic supply issues, the booms in these markets basically torpedoed the availability of certain high-end computer equipment, such as graphics cards.

And then there's so... SO much more bullshit piled on top of it from the psychology of NFT discords and groups, the fake humanitarianism via the Axie game, to what certain people are claiming NFTs could do and it's mostly idealistic, complete shit, or completely idealistic shit. People on the outside are treating crypto and NFTs like an MLM because it's the closest tangible comparison. That's before the realization that NFTs are bits of caveman code that can do what code has done in the hands of the malicious for the last 15 years: scam, cheat, and destroy. Oh and good luck getting justice for that since the system is purposely obtuse in nature to stop man in the middle attacks (attacks that have been pointless for a while when you can just ask grandma for her credit card information and steal everything that way) unless you already had a fuck off amount of money.

When it comes down to it, NFT sellers are selling you a position in a queue that is associated with a program that you don't own that generally points to a fugly procedurally generated image on a server that runs the same shut down risk as any other image on the internet. You don't own shit.

Lamprophonia,"Answer: The long and short of it, NFT's are a scam.  When a celebrity or big twitch streamer gets rich selling NFT's, they do so at the expense of their often young and gullible fanbase.  That's the core of the anger... anyone trying to praise or prop up NFTs as anything other than a scam to stay far away from are doing so because they are in on the grift, and have a vested financial incentive to convince you to buy in.

Slightly more detailed version: NFT's are specifically a [greater fool scam.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory)  They have no value at all.  Absolutely none.  When you buy an NFT you aren't given ownership of an image, you don't own a copy of the image, you don't own anything... you're given a reference on a blockchain that points to a location on a server where a copy of an image is stored.  You own absolutely nothing.  If you buy an NFT of a banana and I, the guy who runs the server the image is hosted on, decides to change all of the images to pictures of my own nose hair then you are now the proud owner of a blockchain pointer to a copy of a picture of my nosehair.  Or I could delete it entirely and you own a blockchain pointer to nothing.

The only actual monetary value from buying an NFT is the assumption that you can then sell that NFT on to someone else at a greater value.  No money is injected into the market during a mint, it's ENTIRELY from a speculation sale.  Since there's no actual thing being sold, you are entirely dependent on the speculation of the NFT you're holding... thus, the only way for you to actually profit is to convince the next guy, the 'greater fool' if you will, that it's value will go up from where it is now so they should buy it from you to turn a profit later.

No matter what, this is a zero sum game... eventually the value of that NFT drops to near zero, and someone is left holding a worthless pointer that they paid good money for.  That's the grift.  Buy, hoping there will be a greater fool than yourself.

One of the more common ways for someone to make a profit off of this grift is to basically already be famous or semi-famous with a fanbase who trusts you.  It makes it very easy to buy or mint NFTs, artificially inflate the market value by basically selling back and forth to yourself over and over, hop on twitch and convince people that there's money to be made in this particular NFT, you sell it off to them and the value immediately drops.  Celebrities taking advantage of trusting fans in a pump and dump.

This is illegal in basically any other market, but NFTs are decentralized and unregulated.  There's no recourse from getting scammed, and nothing is stopping these people from just running the same pump and dump scam over and over and over.

Beardy_Boy_,"Answer:. Fundamentally, an NFT is a unique token on a blockchain.  All this really means is that it's an entry on the ledger that can be tracked to that specific transaction.  It's kind of a cryptocurrency where only one of the token is ever produced.

People are buying NFTs that are supposedly connected to things like digital art, Twitter posts, and the like, with the idea being that they hold some sort of ownership over the thing itself.  The problem is that the only thing they actually own is the NFT.  It doesn't give any sort of legal control over the thing it's attached to, it doesn't grant you access to an account, and it doesn't give you any royalties when the items are sold.

NFTs are functionally very similar to buying a plot of land on the moon.  You have a fun little certificate saying you own something, but the reality is that the two things don't map onto each other at all.

I'm sure there must be *some* legitimate use case for NFTs, but for the most part it's just a digital beanie baby, except all you're really buying is an accounting entry.",hvsnahe,t3_sld7yc,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sld7yc/what_is_up_with_nfts/hvsnahe/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,
flyingpimonster,"Answer: The environmental costs are real and lots of people hate NFTs for that. But when it comes to celebrities pushing NFTs, people hate it for being a cash grab. NFTs are fairly cheap to make and sell for high prices due to the hype. However, they don't really provide any practical value (like typical merch would), not even aesthetic value since anyone can *look at* the artwork online. The value of an NFT is only getting to say you are the *owner* of the NFT. Alternately, it's worth what someone else who wants to ""own"" it more than you do will pay you for it.

So it's mostly a way to capitalize on one's fame. It doesn't help that the NFT space is *full* of scams--pump &amp; dumps, wash trading, etc. Often the celebrity gets some money and the fans are left holding the bag when, inevitably, their NFTs aren't worth what they were promised.",hvrq9n3,t3_sld7yc,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sld7yc/what_is_up_with_nfts/hvrq9n3/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

DVeagle74,"Answer: [Here is a good in depth video. ](https://youtu.be/YQ_xWvX1n9g) But to give a shorter answer. Nft stands for Non-Fungible Token. Essentially it's a unique key that can be pointed at anything online as a sort of receipt of ownership. It's verified and transferred using blockchain technology, which uses networked computers to be decentralized and heavy energy costs. Blockchain is also its the tech behind cryptocurrancy like bitcoin.

Issues with nfts come from multiple places, the community around them, their uselessness, their energy impact, and scams.

The community is very hype driven and loud, so you get lots of very intense support and harsh reactions to criticism.

Much like buying a star, or land on the moon, or a title from Sealand, nfts don't really provide much for your ownership. It's digital art, so it's infinitely replicated as anything online. So it mostly comes off as a solution to a problem that doesn't exist. So at the moment it's treated as a speculation product. They are bought to be sold to someone else later, aka digital bennie babies. 

Transactions with nfts use a lot of computers and a a large amount of energy. The environmental impact isn't small.

Scams are also common among nfts. From imcomplete projects, to just simply taking stuff from people. There's little to no regulation so it runs rampant with no recourse.",hvqtqy0,t3_sld7dd,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sld7dd/what_is_up_with_nfts_what_are_they_why_the_hate/hvqtqy0/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,
Sloloem,"Licensing of digital media was already a fairly well-solved problem.  As much as I hate DRM schemes they mostly functioned as long as you stayed away from edge cases, they just didn't have a speculative marketplace or artificial scarcity attached to it.  So if you consider making things worse so that you can try to bilk idiots desperately trying to score some free money by running a hypetrain backed by unregulated speculation a solution to anything...then NFTs are your solution.

The NFT is just a link embedded in a transaction on an immutable distributed transaction ledger saying that this hash token is currently assigned to Steve McSteve's Wallet.  So it's ownership really only in a technical sense that some chunk of metadata is assigned to a user account and not in any material or legal way.  That's really all it proves, anything more is a gentleman's agreement that ""Sure, I'll say you own whatever file is at the other end of that link.  I'll even let you sell me a new transaction that says it's not assigned to my wallet.""  Can't really do anything else with it.

Block chain doesn't even really establish provenance, just establishes who created the transaction and what wallet it's assigned to.  Plenty of NFT's point at stolen artwork that the person who minted wasn't granted any permission to use and certainly isn't paying royalties on.

But let's be clear about the main point here for anyone still playing along at home:  There is no such thing as ownership of digital media.  Ownership implies scarcity and because it is digital there can be no scarcity.  To digital media you either have access or you don't but no matter how many people are given access to a piece of digital media, it will _never_ run out.  It's frankly more difficult to limit consumption of a digital asset than it is to allow consumption.

Scarcity of tokens is a purely artificial construct and exists entirely for its own sake.  It doesn't carry with it any rights, ownership, or value.  Its scarcity that means nothing because it's trying to impose itself on something that is for all intents and purposes, post-scarcity.

chaosof99,"NFTs are in general considered bad for a number of reasons:

1) NFTs are a ""bigger fool"" scam. NFTs only appreciate in value not because they themselves have an intrinsic market value that rises and falls with supply and demand, but because you sold it to someone else for a higher price than you bought it for.

2) NFTs are bought and sold for with Etherium and other cryptocurrencies. They are sometimes considered a prop to push up the cryptocurrency marketplace. The most common cryptocurrencies are made through ""proof of work"", which is basically a mechanism that sets a math riddle. The first person that solves it gets cryptocurrency for it. However, this is a race, so every other participant who also attempted and invested resources (energy, processor time) gets nothing, and all this redundant work serves nothing.

3) The verification of NFTs and actions on them (e.g. transferring them to another owner) are also done with proof of work or similar inefficient mechanisms.

The supposed use case for NFTs in games is that you can trade in-game items on a different marketplace, and you game developers could use such in-game items from existing games in theirs. However, this use case is absurd on its face. Games are insular spaces. You don't want to have outside code in your game, and I doubt any developer would want to spend time and effort implementing items from another game. It also makes no sense to distribute verifiability, since you always have to verify against the platform owner anyhow.

Also, because it is decentralized, there is no government that will take responsibility for crimes committed on them, so it is perfect for money laundering. 

As for the pokemon cards, nobody knew what was in the box. A company certified that the box matched the description and had the proper labels and was the correct weight, but it's impossible to know what was truly in the box until opened. Having an NFT connected to a physical object would not have helped because it still cannot guarantee the object in the box is actually in there, regardless of whether you own the NFT. And if you're just going to trade digital cards, then sure, the NFT could help with that but your relying on the game itself as a centralized monitoring tool to use the card within the game. But that can already be done within a game with internal checks. Decentralizing this piece of it is nonsensical unless there is a secondary platform that supports the NFT with the same game code. So far nobody has actually successfully created an NFT that corresponds to an in-game item that transfers between games. It is a nonsensical idea considering the NFT cannot provide the necessary gaming code to introduce the item within every game, so it would have to be manually created within each platform which will literally never happen.

Imagine buying a comb from ""Silky Hair"". There are millions of these combs out there but the one you bought for thousands of dollars is the favorite comb of your favorite celebrity. The value of this comb therefore comes from all other fans who want this comb.

  
Same with the idea of NFTs. The value comes from a few millionaires hyping up NFTs and therefore raising the value ""because they deem it valuable"". It's even common practice to sell an NFT to yourself for insane amounts using a fake account or by cooperating with another seller for a minor fee - just to make the news!

  
Plus keeping track of all the transactions consumes a lot of energy and basically kills our planet which in regards of the actual usefulness of NFTs is pretty shit - same with bitcoins btw.

Iseedeadnames,"Answer: it is not digital art you own. When you buy an NFT you buy (usually) the right to reproduce a certain image, similarly to how you only get a licence for Windows rather the ownership of your copy.

The implications are numerous, but just to sum up a couple: the image resides on a server and not your PC therefore making it inaccessible should the link with the server disappear, the image is not unique and the author can sell it to multiple people (stark difference with regular art market), the image itself is not what you buy since you're buying instead the blockchain that leads to your NFT. The blockchain structure does prevent theft or misuse of said NFT and the token itself will remain unique in your possession, but the system is unable to control the media outside the crypto itself; aka, the token will stay yours but the image itself contained within can be copied through screenshots, photos or similar systems. The only way to protect a NFT outside the blockchain circuit is through international laws, that at the moment are a bit hazy on the subject and it's really not clear whether someone could be sued for copyright breach for using a NFT screenshot in their profile.

To mint and sell an NFT you don't need to own any right to the image, you can simply take any jpg or screenshot from the web. Some crafted NFTs from the profiles and images owned by dead youtubers and influencers, some have created NFTs from popular and common memes; you can easily understand that in this kind of setting it's pretty hard to seriously consider any pretense of legitimacy for copyright claims.

The NFT market is also plagued by money laundering, with people buying tokens for high sums just to trade in money made with illegal activities that take advantage of the lack of control on crypto trades.",hvaaxg8,t3_siqg2r,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/siqg2r/whats_going_on_with_nfts/hvaaxg8/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

Castriff,"&gt;but imagine if Pokemon cards had a text box that showed you with absolute certainty who created it? It just went from easy to counterfeit and hard to verify, to practically impossible to counterfeit, and extremely easy to verify. 

NFTs do not do this. The point at issue is not what's literally encoded in the blockchain, it's the image the NFT is based on. Having ownership of a token does not inherently mean you have information as to the identity of the artist of the original image, nor does it inherently grant you copyright of said original. In that sense, NFTs will ALWAYS be easily counterfeited, because the ""right-clicking"" you supposedly laugh at is the exact method by which people mint NFTs based on art they didn't create.

Castriff,"&gt;As long as people understand that they own the NFT and NOT the art

I guarantee you, out of those who are legitimately interested in buying NFTs, at least 90% (a generous estimate, in my opinion) either don't understand this in the slightest, or are taking advantage of those who don't. In fact, the token doesn't even guarantee that the link to the server which holds the artwork will remain usable. Not only do you not own the art, you can't do anything to keep the art where you want it to be. (That's the difference between NFTs and physical collectibles; with Beanie Babies the buyer can keep them safe in a location of their choosing, and even take out insurance on them so you get your money's worth in the event of a fire or burglary.) So what would it matter that it can't be forged if it also doesn't do what it's supposed to do in the first place? You're out hundreds, if not millions, of dollars for a string of code that isn't even human-readable. The tokens themselves would be far less valuable to people if they understood that, because without the sentimental value the only other utility for the token is selling it off to someone else.

(I mean, I'm sure there's at least one person in the world who would want to maintain a collection of non-human-readable code, but whoever they are, without the associated image it'd be a whole lot easier to convince other people that said code wasn't worth the price they paid for it.)",hv6sjda,t1_hv6fq42,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sh9x9g/whats_going_on_with_video_game_companies/hv6sjda/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,
HuskieMuffenz,"Thank you for reading my comment! I hope you got something out of it. I just wanted to give some background as to why they exist and what the intention of them was Vitalik Buterin (guy who made Ethereum) and friends laid out a roadmap for what they envisioned the purpose of their work being.

(Read the original idea from them here: https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)

I find anything related to blockchain fascinating and I have loved watching it grow in mature over the past decade or so. I studied cryptography quite extensively in college. I currently work as a software engineer for a large company that offers financial services to people globally. I feel like my professional life has given me a lot more background knowledge and context to what these are actually trying to do. 

Ethereum is 6 years old. It is brand spanking new. In 10 years it will probably work very differently than it does now. 

(Actually in a short period of time it will change considerably in order to increased transaction volume and decrease gas prices.
 https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/)

Lots of people have said I'm trying to encourage people to put their money into a cryptocurrency or NFTs for my own personal gain. This is absolutely not the case. I have nothing invested in Ethereum. I do not want to encourage anyone to do so. I don't know if it is a bad idea or a good idea. I just think it's a really cool idea from a technical standpoint.

From what I can tell, the reddit hivemind has decided that NFTs are bad and anything related to NFTs is bad. They are a scam. Anyone who thinks NFTs are not evil is wrong and a scam artist. I've seen a lot of people trying to give a technical perspective on these and just get downvoted to oblivion.

With that the hive mind is correct in that a lot of companies are trying to leverage these as a way to extract more value from their consumers. This is sad.

DrHemroid,"Answer: NFTs are the more palatable version of Play to Earn, which major game publishers want to start adding to their games. https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2021/12/13/play-to-earn-gaming-is-driving-nft-and-crypto-growth

The question that should be asked is: why are the studios pushing for Play to Earn?

Play to Earn in theory is the idea that by playing a game, you have the potential to earn real world money. In practice, Play to Earn is a way to prey on human psychology to get people addicted to ""playing"" a game for  a low payout, similar to a gambling mindset. There are currently hundreds of Play to Earn ""games"" available now that are simply used as vehicles to serve as many ads to users as possible. The ""gameplay"" is typically on the scale of copy pasted minigames you've already seen from mobile games or browser based flash games. What keeps people playing isn't the joy of playing, it's the financial insensitive and addiction.

I wish there were published studies on this topic, but it appears that this is too new. I could only find articles about games being designed to be more addictive, and one factor is the idea that virtual goods = physical goods in our minds, and adding a real world value / NFT to game items serves as a way to further cement this idea, and thus make make games more addictive. https://gamequitters.com/are-video-games-addictive/

So the answer to original question, why are game developers rushing to add NFTs to their games? It's because they see NFTs as a way to add Play to Earn to their games without facing universal backlash from the gaming community. There will be a lot of backlash from gamers due to how despised and ridiculed NFTs currently are, but now they can hide behind the vocal fans of NFTs.

And the reasons game developers want to add Play to Earn to their games is simple: make the games more addictive, make more people want to play your game, and make the people playing your games want to play longer. In addition, there will likely be a fee for every NFT sold on the marketplace which goes directly to the game developers, meaning from the game developer perspective, NFTs are simply a source of increased revenue.",hv5whhb,t3_sh9x9g,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sh9x9g/whats_going_on_with_video_game_companies/hv5whhb/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

HuskieMuffenz,"That's an excellent point! It's much ado about nothing if nobody cares at all. For the NFT pipe dream to be fully realized it would require most of the world's legislatures to see a specific blockchain as essentially the US patent and copyright office. You would need lawyers to physically enforce it.

I personally think NFTs in their current state are pretty useless and require years of work before they can mature into something that adds value to the world. I have nothing invested in them and I don't want to encourage anyone to allocate their resources towards them. I studied cryptology extensively in college and find that whole subject area very interesting. I currently work for a big company that provides a lot of financial services. The goal of my comment was to give some perspective into what the people who were actually building these are thinking.

I think the real long-term mainstream applications of blockchain will revolve around integrating itself into pre-existing financial services to make the process more efficient. Most economic zones are currently exploring a central bank digital currency, think government issued stable coins.

I've also heard a lot of interesting ideas around cryptocurrencies being able to provide a lot of the same financial services that people in more developed nations enjoy. If you don't have a stable bank these are very attractive as a supplement. Those people do not think NFTs are attractive.

&gt;  
&gt;Like you said Bitcoin is limited by its own algorithms, no one can just pull a Bitcoin out of thin air. But, anyone can copy and edit an image to be unique

The supporters are trying to conflate the idea of ""no one can just pull a Bitcoin out of thin air"" with NFTs. 

Both depend on the blockchain, aka a digital public ledger. The idea is that someone mines a Bitcoin or mints an NFT, that digitial item is entered into the blockchain under their wallet. They can then transfer it to others, and the blockchain records it every step along its journey.

But a Bitcoin isn't actually unique: like any fiat currency, it's just a line on the ledger. Likewise, the NFT isn't actually an object to be possessed, it's just a fancy web bookmark pointing to the server which hosts the original image. Neither of them hold any intrinsic value, it's all in ""whoever has this digital ID in their digital wallet can trade it for real-world money.""

As you point out, the art itself isn't protected in any way. The NFT ""certificate"" just shows that you hold that token from the original minting. If someone else mints an NFT of the exact same image, well, the two of you can argue on the Internet which token is ""more authentic,"" but there's no regulatory body to oversee the value of either.

NFT bros will claim that the first minting is ""obviously"" the valuable one, but there's absolutely nothing to back that up. All NFTs are just worth whatever someone will trade for them, and there's zero technical system to prevent making copies &amp; minting new NFTs of the same art file.

This is the Achilles heel of NFTs: with no system of digital rights management (DRM), NFTs have no protection for the investor. Cryptobros will argue that the ledger itself is sufficient and people just need to learn how to do the research for themselves to prevent being scammed... but ultimately, this ""you're on your own"" attitude is the core weakness of NFTs. The NFT cheerleaders are so convinced of their own intelligence that they refuse to see the fatal flaws in the system as flaws at all, because then the whole house of cards would come tumbling down and their ""investments"" would be worthless.

NFTs only provide value so long as they keep pulling new recruits into the scheme.

BluegrassGeek,"It's one of the major thoughts behind crypto, yes. The true-believers think that having this decentralized ledger solves all the problems of ""trust"" involved with banks, governments, etc. Since you can just check the blockchain to verify the transaction, you can ""see for yourself"" who owns the NFT/coin.

... but it's all based on this magical thinking that, somehow, seeing the transaction is *good enough* to verify ownership. It's very libertarian ""possession is 9/10ths of the law"" thinking. The idea is that only stupid people could be tricked into transferring their coins/NFTs to a scam account, and of course *they* are too smart to ever make such a mistake.

Which ignores all the mistakes people are making constantly with blockchain transactions &amp; scams. And that brings us to the other group behind blockchain: the ones who recognize it doesn't really work, but think they can get rich off the true-believers.

There aren't many rational reasons you would need an NFT in a video game. Almost any example could be solved with a centralized server, and it would likely be much safer.

Examples that have been given are things we have already been doing for years and without NFTs. Moving an asset from one game to another? Many Blizzard games offer this. Unique items? Something you'll find in any looter-shooter.  Buy and sell items? Literally was something we had in Diablo 3 and people hated it. Many other games offer that ability as well.

An NFT is like a crypto token, where each token is different. You can make whatever you want from this basis. It seems that Ubisoft will propose NFTs as a pointless achievement unlocker.

About claiming it is similar to a claim on moon land. I think it is an incorrect comparison. For collectibles, NFT strongly depends on the collection it is in.

You have a group of developers that commit to offer an nft together.  These developers create a unique skin, a full body tiger costume for example.  They agree that this skin is in every game they make.  They agree that every time time the nft is sold, they each get some portion of that sales price.  The nft is sold for $10k to start.  Hopefully it changes hands many times.  The developers get paid, whomever owns the nft enjoys their skin, and bob's your uncle.

Since minting NFTs of your already existing assets is a lot cheaper than funding the development of a full quality game, gamers fear that the companies will divert resources and develop games of lower quality, though probably at the same price as their existing games.
- Also, incorporating NFTs into gaming is essentially adding a yet another predatory practice for gaming companies to exploit whales and other people with poor impulse control. This is especially bad if they implement a ‚Äúpay to earn‚Äù model. Lure players with the prospect of making money by gaming, giving them crumbs while the company takes a disproportionately large amount of the profit.

donespapo,"Answer: think about it this way. No one ‚Äúowns‚Äù the moon. Yet someone can try to sell you land on the moon, and give you a nice little certificate to ‚Äúprove‚Äù that you do. You‚Äôre not getting any actual land, just the certificate that only other certificate owners (and the grifters who sold it to you) would consider valid. The grifters just need to cover the costs of a business that makes paper and/or pdf certificates, which is easy since THEY didn‚Äôt have to actually buy land on the moon.

NFTs are essentially unique ‚Äúreceipts‚Äù that are often linked to digital goods, such as (in this case) video game achievements. It doesn‚Äôt make you the ‚Äúowner‚Äù of that achievement, since plenty of players could reach the same achievement. What is unique is the ‚Äúreceipt‚Äù, ie a ‚Äúnon-fungible token‚Äù that cannot be duplicated. It‚Äôs a receipt that grants you bragging rights to the receipt. 

Now, normally you can sell NFTs for crypto, and buying prices are relatively arbitrary. People will pay ridiculous amounts of money to claim that they ‚Äúown‚Äù a meme, a piece of digital art, etc. Creating (called ‚Äúminting‚Äù) NFTs, on the other hand can therefore be very profitable if you can convince some poor sucker that it‚Äôs valuable.

Tony_Chu,"In order to generate and maintain a block chain, there needs to be a lot of computational time spent.  The quickest way to perform all of the calculations quickly in order to produce as much as possible is to use fast processors, including GPUs.  

This uses a lot of electricity.  Since there is a lot of money in crypto (speculative, scammy, utilitarian, and otherwise), some outfits around the world have set up voraciously energy consuming warehouses full of many linked processors.  Additionally, literally millions of people around the globe are running processors hot 24/7 in order to try to mine crypto and create NFTs.  

It has stressed the manufacturing and supply chain for processors world wide, affecting everything from car manufacturing to the availability of PS5 consoles.  

And all of the energy consumption requires energy production.  Despite all of our growth towards green energy in recent years, as a species the majority of our energy production is still very very impactive in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.  All of this crypto has very appreciatively moved the needle. 

If human contributions to climate change are real (they are, but that's a separate conversation), then crypto is fast becoming a major contributor.  

All that said - NFTs are potentially the scammiest and least utilitarian of the crypto offerings (besides, you know, like *literal* scam tokens).  The people evangelizing NFTs are trying to make money off of a trend, but when you scrutinize the ""value"" of NFTs as they articulate it - there isn't anything there because at the end of the day is really *is* just a trend, and nothing else.  

At least when your car hurts the environment, it's also getting you somewhere and letting you work.

gogilitan,"Answer: You will never see criticism of NFTs in NFT friendly space because the value of NFTs is entirely based on speculation. ""Community leaders"" have a financial incentive to squash all criticism and promote wider adoption.

The ingroup is told to hodl with diamondhands and not give in to FUD, and if they do that then everyone will get rich. Anyone concerned gets ostracized or banned.

The same can be said about gamestop. As a company, it's largely irrelevant (brick and mortar store in a digital age). Maybe some day it'll do something of note again, but right now (since the GME stock hype has long since been left behind) the vast majority of people couldn't give less of a shit about it. The only people really talking about it have a financial interest in keeping the community around it positive.

I say this as someone who's actually very pro-crypto... there are some significant differences.

Ethereum, the main type of crypto all of these NFTs are based on, runs on something called ""proof of work"" to ""mine"" Ethereum coins.

""Proof of work"" basically means randomly guessing the answers to very, very complex math problems. That's a gross oversimplification (it's not exactly random guessing, etc), but it's close enough. 

Because of this, to ""mine"" (produce more coins) Ethereum, you need to spend a lot of electricity making these guesses. The amount of electricity used far, *far* exceeds the computer's normal electrical usage.

ApeWiddaCape,"Answer: The consensus indeed *is* that NFTs are at best a joke, and at worst scams. The GME hype is absolutely no different, but Apes are bagholders.

What has happened is that Gamestop shareholders on Reddit (""Apes"") have been spending *months* trying to figure out what Gamestop's forward prospectus really is. See, Chewy founder Ryan Cohen took over as Chair of Gamestop, with a vague intention to pivot Gamestop to an e-commerce/culture oriented gaming store. Cohen is somewhat famously cagey about his plans, but has a strong reputation in some circles from his work with Chewy.

Understand, Apes are bagholders. A year ago there was the famous ""squeeze"". Bagholders from that ""squeeze"" have since elaborated a vast meta-conspiracy theory claiming that Wall Street is manipulating the stock price etc. Gamestop stock had sold for over $300 again back in May/June, and has turbulently declined ever since. The volume profile statistics of GME stock suggest the average cost basis for retail shareholders is likely $190 at least. So the Apes are desperate to justify why their stock is worth what they paid. Their ""movement"" has a staunch culture of not selling their shares in protest of alleged Wall Street malfeasance.

Gamestop has been advertising jobs for blockchain related talent. Apes have thus constructed various theories, some of which are *absolutely insane*, regarding Gamestop's blockchain aspirations.

So, they hype the idea that Gamestop is going to have an NFT marketplace that will become dominant, even revolutionary, in the space. The various ideas that get hyped are too many to cover, but they all involve the use of the Loopring ethereum platform.

The issue is that, while Gamestop no doubt plans to do *something* in the blockchain/NFT space, they have virtually no transparency. Their shareholders have no idea what they are doing. NFTs are derided by the gaming community at large, and completely mocked by financial analysts/pundits as a fad. For example, Wedbush's Michael Pachter, a long time gaming industry analyst, has stated Gamestop has ""no role"" in the future of NFTs, and that the corporate office simply lacks the relationships and goodwill with developers to execute anything major.

Apes hype *all kinds* of extravagant things they believe Gamestop could achieve, but, frankly, it is nonsense. Gamestop Corp has *never* endorsed anything Apes speculate.  The company is still unprofitable. The share price is down 60% in the last 9 weeks. Apes are desperate to foment a new wave of retail FOMO action.

TitaniumDragon,"Answer: Crypto is fundamentally a pyramid scheme. Cryptocurrency has no actual value - unlike national fiat money, it isn't supported by a tax base, and unlike, say, gold, there is no physical commodity associated with it. It isn't even useful as currency because the transaction speed is too low.

As such, its value is entirely dependent on how much money people are willing to dump into it - the only way to make money off of crypto is for new suckers to come along and pay even more money for it.

And they're running out of suckers.

NFTs drew more attention to crypto, and crypto in general has been drawing greater regulatory scrutiny in the last year or so. And people haven't been liking what they've been seeing. People are becoming more active in attacking cryptocurrency for the pyramid scheme that it is. At the same time, NFTs drew money from suckers away from standard crypto markets.

On top of all this, the supposed ""value"" of cryptocurrency is actually held up by fraud, primarily committed by Tether and similar groups, which are under criminal investigation for market manipulation... because they are engaging in market manipulation and fraud.

Many companies that experimented with accepting crypto dumped it because it is terrible as currency, removing what little real-world value it ever had.

So you're looking at a pyramid scheme - which is dependent on always pulling in more people with more money - no longer doing so to the same extent, as people are growing increasingly wary of it. The people who have been involved in doing very illegal things in crypto are under legal pressure, and it has no real world value backing it up.

Game items are one of the worst use cases yet - the game server is 100% authoritative on what the NFT actually means, there's no benefit to using them. Nothing about how NFTs work would magically compel a developer to make them tradeable if they didn't want to, and likewise NFTs aren't required if a game dev did want tradeable items.

And most players actively don't want real-money purchasing of gameplay items in the first place since it incentivizes pay-to-win design.

SanityInAnarchy,"&gt; That's like saying I can 100% perfectly forge a dollar bill, except for the serial number. At that point it isn't a forgery lol

Isn't it? If you can make an absolutely perfect clone of a dollar bill, except it has a serial number that doesn't match one that the US Treasury actually minted, what are the chances someone catches you out on this if you try to spend it?

With NFTs, you have a similar problem: If I say I have the Charlie Bit My Finger NFT, and you open it in an app and it shows you the video, and you buy it for some amount of real money, at that point it's your problem that the serial number doesn't actually match.

This isn't a theoretical problem -- one thing that's happening with NFTs right now is, tons of people are just outright stealing other people's art off places like DeviantArt and making NFTs of them. Of course the artist could buy in and sell a ""real"" NFT, but they'd be competing with their own work! And the people buying this art clearly aren't checking that it has the same serial number as one the original artist sold.

So how do you make sure the NFT you're buying is actually *the* one created and sold by the person you think it is? Like that time Jack Dorsey sold an NFT of his first tweet? The answer is a web of centralized services -- Jack's tweet was created with [this handy centralized service](https://v.cent.co/tweet/20), which creates at most one NFT per tweet when the author (who logs in with Twitter) asks for it.

And at that point, I have a bunch of questions: What happens if that ""valuables"" site goes under? Or gets hacked? Or decides it wants to make counterfeits? Or just *pretends* someone famous made an account and sells one of their tweets so the owners can cash in?

More importantly, since all of the above can happen, what was the point of involving the blockchain? They could've just used a centralized database.",htv96ll,t1_htu8kgu,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sag3bu/what_is_the_deal_with_nfts/htv96ll/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

Pandoras_Fox,"&gt; Seriously curious, why can't you own something like a skin in a video game? I get a picture of a monkey is silly to care about as a nft, but where is the failure point if we're talking about digital assets that aren't just a picture?

The thing is that there's nothing new here - we already have stuff like this (e.g. the steam community market); if you want the skin to be truly portable across games then games need to buy-in on all that and pick and choose what NFTs etc to handle, which essentially means you need some amount of centralization on which stuff to support so it's truly universal.

To put it another way, there is nothing of technical merit here. For example, twitter's NFT profile picture stuff could just as easily be ""we partnered with DeviantArt to let you link your account via oAuth and let you pick a verified icon and banner you commissioned and paid for"" instead of whatever shit they're doing with NFTs, and it would be *wildly* more efficient to do this with a traditional database this way.

The only real value-add in all of this is the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies. That is, the only ""value"" here is __there is no actual authority__ that can step in in cases of fraud/theft/etc; the value-add of NFTs and cryptocurrencies is that scamming is MUCH easier and is a feature, not a bug.

&gt; Isn't this what nfts do for theoretically anything that exists online?

I'm not really sure what you mean here, but if you mean 'can't you make an nft of any asset you can have a URL point to', the answer is yes, but it's pretty much as pointless with anything else - the underlying cryptocurrency is essentially just a shitty database that's supposed to be special because it's immutable and public.

That's not to say that there's no technical merit at all in distributed public ledgers, but the things that would actually benefit from this in some way (e.g. distributed computing projects like folding@home or seti@home) still don't use them because they're public research projects with a governing body, so there's just no point to introduce that bottleneck and inefficiency.",htuo7d7,t1_htuelhe,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sag3bu/what_is_the_deal_with_nfts/htuo7d7/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

This is just a high-level view of the current way they are handled from someone who knows enough about computers to steer clear of NFTs. You could make your own custom NFT and even include the file directly in the blockchain transaction. Really you would encrypt it with the public or private key (depending if you wanted it to be visible to everyone or just the buyer) of the account you are selling it to. No one does this since you have to pay for every byte in the transaction. It's a significant cost to prevent the chain from expanding uncontrollably.

And therein lies one of the primary problems of NFTs, they're only as good as the data that's put into them, and there's no verification on that side of things. They only stop man-in-the-middle attacks of someone messing with already existing tokens, but does nothing to stop someone lying and feeding in bad information into the system in the first place and creating 'bad' tokens.

Sure you can check that someone indeed minted an NFT for something first, but that doesn't mean it was the original creator that did that. Maybe the original-creator has never made an NFT for the art-piece, and it was someone else that just lied and said they owned that art-piece and minted the NFT for it first.

LionSuneater,"Cryptocurrencies enable users to verify transactions with no central agency, right? This is what bitcoin's blockchain is about. That's what makes it a candidate for a new form of money, because money is a medium of transaction. Money is *fungible*, meaning interchangeable. That is, if you and I trade each other equal amounts of bitcoin, there is no fundamental economic exchange.

**NFTs seek to extend the idea of blockchain to decentralize the verification process of *nonfungible* objects, meaning *unique goods*.** 

In the physical world, we value works of art, hand-crafted goods, and limited-print copies of items as nonfungible items. They have value due to their rarity. 

This is clearly where NFT art got its start. The question with NFT art, however, is ""what am I buying?"" At it's core, you're receiving a digital signature from the artist, and as a society we have rightfully questioned the value of such a signature. Without virtual worlds and virtual galleries that can uniquely host artworks, what worth do we truly have yet? But, I digress, because there are many other nonfungible items. 

Consider a car or a dog. These are both unique, personal goods who often come with licenses. These licenses are controlled by a central agency. NFTs would allow a way around that. A more abstract, but in a sense simpler application would be *virtual car or virtual dog* ownership. It's a bit farfetched now, but it could happen.

Most of the metaphors are either saying it's like ""buy a star"" or it's like ""a receipt."" I wonder what article caused those to catch on, because it sounds a bit like parroting.

SanityInAnarchy,"&gt; I've also seen someone say that that person has their name on a list that the own it but that's it, they have no rights or access to the file.

That's pretty close to right. Or at least, they don't have anything special other than having their name in that list -- usually, we can all access the exact same file in the exact same way that they can.

Also, while each NFT is unique, the files they link to aren't. There's nothing that stops me making an NFT of the exact same file. The thing that's actually unique is the underlying serial number. So:

&gt; For example, I don't remember if it's David After Dentist or Charlie Bit Me but the OP of one of those videos sold the original as an NFT.

Anyone can make a brand-new NFT of the exact same video.

So what's the point? If you're asking that, you're on the right track...

Easiest way to think of it is: Each NFT *does* have a unique number, like a serial number. So if you know which NFT that the Charlie Bit Me guy sold, you'd know who actually owns that specific NFT, and not any of the *100% perfect forgeries* that might exist now.

But that's it. That's the whole thing. You can watch the video without owning the NFT. The NFT doesn't actually give you copyright or anything. The thing the NFT links to is almost completely irrelevant.

Basically, it's buying a serial number that you can resell.

The ""real"" uses of NFTs that you talk about aren't really anything more than daydreams at the moment.

&gt; A Non Fungible Token can be created for concert tickets, which can be verified on a block chain.

OK, now try describing what the point of this is without using vague buzzwords such as ""verified"" and ""block chain"". Concert venues can already do all kinds of things with their tickets: electronic sales, entry with an app or QR code instead of a physical ticket, ID verification to prevent touting/scalping, and resale systems, for example. What could they do with an NFT ticket that they can't do already?

The entire point of cryptocurrencies and NFTs is that there is supposedly no centralized authority (ignoring the ones that seem to keep cropping up in practice such as Bitfinex, the Ethereum Foundation, etc.). But with a concert there is a centralized authority: the venue. They decide who gets in and who doesn't. So it's hard to understand what could possibly be achieved by putting the ticketing under the control of a decentralized system.

&gt; There's NFT online card games - NFT's can be used to declare world first boss kills on games - Can be used for unique equipment ownership.

Again, online games generally have a centralized authority who can do this stuff without NFTs. And if there isn't a centralized authority, then what's to stop anyone from forking or modding the game and giving themselves the unique equipment?

Not to mention that high score tables and unique skins in games aren't exactly the most important thing in the world.

slowlybecomingsane,"Answer: The amount of technilogically uninformed and frankly emotive responses here is disappointing and not what this sub is about.

NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) are just cryptographic tokens that don't have the property of fungibility. Fungibility means t washat each single 'thing' of its type is identical to all other things of its type. The dollar is fungible because it doesn't matter which dollar you have, you can pay for things all the same. Bitcoin and Ether are fungible cryprocurrencies too.

NFTs are tokens that live on a blockchain at a particular address (the owner's) that have data encoded within them that anyone can see. This means they have a huge range of use cases. for example, they could be used for tickets, where they could be encoded with the seat number of the ticket. They can be used as proof of ownership of a real or digital asset too. Breitling the watch manufacturer has starting using NFTs that prove authenticity of their watches and also have the full service history encoded within them. If someone sells that watch but does not have access to the wallet that contains the NFT, that watch can be assumed to be stolen or fake, for example.

At the moment people are tokenising digital art on the blockchain by encoding a URL that links to a place on the internet where that image is hosted.  Now, like anything, people are trying to capitalise on this and are making low effort attempts with poor practises when creating these NFTs, but digital artists, by creating these NFTs, have cryptographic proof that they are in fact the original creator, meaning it is impossible to just copy the art and claim it as your own - the artist can just prove they made an NFT of that art first. Some of these images are hosted in servers, which many people point out defeats the object of the decentralised nature of NFTs. If that server goes down, the image is no longer hosted there and the NFT points to an empty URL. IPFS is a decentralised storage system where files (the image in this case) is split up into small chunks and distributed across many nodes. IPFS sends back a content ID (CID) that can be used to reconstitute the uploaded file from all of those nodes, which is what is often encoded in the NFT.

So yes, there are a lot of scams. There are also a hell of a lot of brilliant communities based on great artists. It isn't for everyone but this technology is absolutely not going away any time soon, it will only mature as people realise the potential of what NFTs can do.",htts77b,t3_sag3bu,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sag3bu/what_is_the_deal_with_nfts/htts77b/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

KazutoYuuki,"Answer: An NFT stands for a ""non fungible token"", which is supposed to act as a kind of digital receipt that you ""own"" an item. In theory, an NFT could act as a voucher of ownership for something like a piece of artwork or similar. In practice, that's usually not what happens. The basic premise is that each NFT's ownership is stored on a blockchain like Ethereum. By storing the data on an immutable distributed ledger, your the voucher that says you own the object is cryptographically verifiable to be yours, assuming you don't lose your private key that backs the digital wallet.

The problem comes into play when you consider what is being ""owned"" and how the underlying item is being stored. Most NFTs are digital URLs that point to a location on either IPFS, as you said, or on the public internet. This is because it would cost a lot of money and electricity to store the actual data behind an NFT on a blockchain like Ethereum. This is because each transaction requires ""gas"", which is a sort of measure of the amount of data used in the transaction. If an NFT were actually a .png image or something, the gas cost associated with storing it on the Ethereum blockchain would be so high as to be impractical.

Most NFTs are vouchers that assign ""ownership"" to images. However, there are many problems with this. First, just like normal images, anyone can save them. That's probably to-be expected. However, most NFT artwork is actually generated by algorithms, which makes it uncopyrightable, and therefore, even if you technically own the voucher, you have no rights over the actual image. If you stole someone's photograph and posted it on the Internet, technically, you could have the image taken down via DMCA, sue the individual for copyright infringement, or something else. Because of the ""NFT craze"", many people made NFT ""galleries"" that are nothing more than algorithmically generated and uncopyrightable images. This is often why they're called scams -- because the artwork being ""sold"" is really just not sold in any useful way. You can prove you own a voucher for a particular image, but the image itself has no value.

Could NFTs be useful? Well, yes, in theory. For example, an artist might choose to sell their work via an NFT, and then allow the owner of the data to change hands based on the NFT. But the amount of artists who currently sell NFTs based on human created art is low, and most of them don't sell or assign any rights to NFT owners. They're just giving you a transferable license to use the art in some way (which is just like how normal art works). Again, in practice, there are very few legitimate artists that sell NFTs. They exist, but they're rare, and the vast majority of the NFT ecosystem is generative art, which can't be copyrighted.

Most NFTs are sold on platforms like OpenSea. While NFT proponents will say that they're decentralized models of ownership, these platforms are centralized. In practice, many apps that display NFTs are using APIs that run on OpenSea. This means that the benefits of decentralization are essentially lost by virtue of these marketplaces and authorities having control over the app ecosystem.

Finally, there's a large amount of criticism about the environmental cost of NFTs, as well as downstream economic effects. The networks that power cryptocurrencies like Ethereum require immense amounts of electricity to run graphics cards or ASICs (in the case of bitcoin-style currencies) to actually run the network. This means that to buy an NFT, you're potentially using electricity, which isn't often renewable, to essentially just transfer items around, which is inefficient. This has also fed into the massive supply-chain crisis, which results in graphics cards being sold-out everywhere.

tl;dr: In theory, NFTs could be useful digital ownership vouchers, but in practice, they're ownership vouchers that are overly centralized, cost a lot of electricity to use, cost a lot of money to run, and are mostly being used to sell generative AI art, which may look cool, but is often not even copyrightable, which confers very little ownership benefit to the NFT holder.

That's a very difficult question to answer objectively, because every person's inner motivations are their own, but I think it generally comes down to two things:

1. The rise of Bitcoin in the past decade has been enormously profitable for early investors and true believers. Because it made so many people *so* filthy rich for so little effort, *everyone* is on the lookout for the next big tech explosion that they can invest into and make insane gains that leave normal investing in the dust. NFTs seem like they could be the ""next Bitcoin"", so people who believe that Bitcoin-esque tech explosions are going to be the new normal in the world, instead of just a once-in-a-lifetime fluke, are doing everything they can to get in on the ground floor.
2. Once you're invested in cryptocurrency or NFTs, you have a very strong financial incentive to ignore any technical problems with them, and engage in lying or deception to downplay their problems and get other people to buy into them. Indeed, NFTs are even *more* dependent on public perception for value than cryotocurrency, so if you own NFTs, you have almost literally invested your money entirely into the idea of ""I bet I can trick the next person into believing that these things are worth even more than what I paid for them"".

Now, the one question that remains is: ""Okay, that explains why people would *buy* NFTs, but why are big internet platforms so eager just to support and legitimize them"". That, I can only speculate on. However, it's kind of common knowledge by this point that one of the initial tricks that the NFT community played to kick off the whole NFT boom was to sell NFTs at hugely inflated prices *to themselves*, creating the perception of value fradulently. And more generally, one of the cornerstones of investing in crypto technologies is finding new and creative ways to trick people into thinking they're increasing in value. So my suspicion would be that if NFTs are seeing quick and heavy support from tech platforms, it's probably either because a) The engineers (or even managers/C-executives) at those companies are invested in NFTs and therefore want to legitimize them in order to increase the value of their personal investments, or b) Those companies have been approached by NFT-promoting companies or collectives and given money directly in order to implement NFT-legitimizing features. The distant third c) option is that these large social media companies have simply realized that they get an inordinately large amount of engagement and ad money out of people who are interested in cryptocurrency and NFTs.",httodas,t3_sag3bu,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/sag3bu/what_is_the_deal_with_nfts/httodas/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

A NFT can be thought of as a receipt for an item that says I own this thing/code/image on the blockchain and everyone using that token accept it. Those not using the token don't have to legally accept it, which is where there is controversy, because until the token is adopted fully the legitimacy of the NFT is basically worthless.

CritterMorthul,"NFTs are a waste of the Blockchain which could actually be used to authenticate digital items, such as games or VR property, things with some form of tangibility.

ElectricGears,"Remember Star Registries where you could buy a star? Or the various scammers that sell land plots on the Moon/planets/asteroids?

And how they're a complete scam since: 1) all you get is your name in some company's database next to a set of coordinates, 2) there is no legally recognized transfer of rights, 3) any other company could sell the same star to someone else, 4) the company never owned the star in the first place. (I guess you do get a fancy certificate which is probably what keep them just barely on the inside of the law.)

**NFT's are Star Registries with extra math.**  
What you get when you buy an NFT is a private key (long random number), which will be recognized by the blockchain as able to sign a transaction to transfer the NFT to someone else. To create one, someone gives a URL to some media file to an NFT company. They generate a JSON file (a formatted text file) with that URL in it, and other optional meta data which included a hash of the media file. The JSON file is added to distributed database or optionally hosted by the NFT company. A blockchain transaction is created and the hash of the JSON file and your public key are added to it. This part is somewhat expensive as there is a charge by the mining nodes for each byte in a transaction. Now your public key is associated with the hash of a file containing a URL and hash of an arbitrary media file. Since you have the corresponding private key, only you can sign a subsequent transaction with the NFT hash and the public key of the new owner. This action is interpreted by the rules of the blockchain as transferring ownership. It is nearly identical to transferring a cryptocurrency balance from one account to another.

All of this *does* have some genuinely useful properties, but only in specific use cases. 99.99% of NFTs (any that you would have heard of) are either money laundering, scams (wash trading, pump and dump, rug-pull), or crypto evangelists exploiting FOMO to sell ""blessed water"" to people with no understanding of the technology.

As to your examples, it is entirely up to the owner of the original media file if they want to give the NFT buyer a copy of the file or include an actual (separately executed) transfer of copyright.

Pandoras_Fox,"It is essentially like those ""buy/name a star!"" things from the 80s/90s, except built on horribly wasteful/inequitable cryptocurrencies. It's just a fundamentally flawed concept at almost every level.

All that it is is a URL on the Blockchain/whatever distributed ledger the backing cryptocurrency uses. That's it - just a url to a picture or whatever. That token ""belongs"" to someone and it's ""theirs"" using the backing cryptocurrency as ""proof"", and they can trade it to other people for money.

With the star agency stuff, you would go to them, pay some money, and get a certificate. Obviously you can't actually OWN or name a star. It's an intangible and silly concept, and some other agency could just ""sell"" the same star to someone else.

With NFTs, people go through ""minting authorities"" to do the same stuff, but with a url that points to an image, and with ecologically harmful cryptocurrencies thrown into the mix.

Like the buy-a-star stuff it's a fundamentally flawed concept: you cannot ""own"" some bytes that make up an image (or the url); other people can just ""mint"" the same image as an NFT, people can steal artists' work and mint it and make money off it without the artist seeing any money, etc.

For the folks that genuinely want some form of digital identity that is theirs: the actual solution here is to just..... give that money to an artist and receive a completely custom and personal commission instead of literally anything resembling the mess that's NFTs.

NotMyStarWars,"Answer: The idea behind it is that it would be a private island for crypto enthusiasts to live and visit. The now-removed video shows stuff like a gym, a casino, a crypto themed beach, a work area, and sixty private residences. Those sixty parcels of land can be purchased for about 1.2 million dollars each, and the owners will be called King Cryptolanders.

Now that's what the island claims to be. The issues are basically endless. For starters, they've let the purchase agreement on the island lapse, so they don't own this island and have no right to sell land on it. The sixty parcels cannot be purchased by US residents, and only gives you the land itself. You'd still have to pay to have a house constructed there. Another big concern is the founders themselves, Max and Helena. They have no experience in real estate, though Helena seems to think her dad having been in real estate is a suitable alternative. What you can find on Max is that he ran a Spanish award show for YouTubers that had to be cancelled because everyone boycotted it. This was because he ran a magazine that lasted one issue that invaded the privacy of Spanish YouTuber.

Then there's the video itself. This is where most of the attention has come from. They've proclaimed it was made by 30 animators from ""Pixar-type"" studios. But anyone that has seen the video knows how lazily it was put together. It's ten minutes of wall-to-wall cringeworthy dialogue, packed with constant references to bitcoin and crypto. It uses the music of John Williams, CHIC, Crazy Frog, Koji Kondo, and the Grease soundtrack for commercial use, which is likely what finally got the video down, as there is no way they spent the money to clear any of these. The video looks bad, sounds bad, and is embarrassing to anyone not obsessed with crypto.

On top of all that, there's the tweet. They were jokingly asked on twitter what the age of consent would be on the island, a reference to both Epstein Island and libertarians (which is what the founders of this project are) occasional iffy views on this topic. Whoever was in charge of the Cryptoland twitter account didn't understand the intent of the question, as English isn't their first language. So they responded by saying ""mental maturity should be enough ;)."" Obviously that's an awful response, making it seem like the island is almost pro-pedophilia. I would say on this, as bad as it looks, they are telling the truth when they say they misunderstood the question. They thought it meant what age do you have to be to visit the island. Regardless, this tweet will likely be the first thing people think about when this project ever comes up.

Another thing worth talking about in regards to these guys, is the almost cult-like behaviour that's asked of their members. They give out free NFTs, but only to people who follow a certain set of instructions. That means changing your twitter avatar to one of their NFTs, which is their mascot Connie from the video. Then you have to positively promote the island online, participate in their raids, and also work towards winning Cryptolander of the week on their discord. Having spent a bit of time on that discord, I can say that no criticism of this project is tolerated. To the wider world, the promo video is unbelievably bad, but to them it's a masterpiece. No one will even have a minor objection to it, except to say that if it is bad, then it's bad on purpose. Max and Helena talk about being open to criticism, but they label all criticism as ""harassment.""

There's honestly so much more I could get into, but this is probably long enough for the moment. The main point is that it's two people with no experience looking at crypto as a way to get a lot of peoples money, but it just isn't happening. They need 50 million dollars to start construction. There are plenty of foolish people in crypto, but I have a tough time imagining them getting that much out of investors.

Though I suspect that voice actors and actresses will be employed for a long time for inflections and such, though: acting as a model for an AI-created voice to imprint on for a particular performance. And, since voice licensing will require a change in intellectual property law, I also suspect that voices will become licensable and protected likenesses; so, while the revenue stream for live performance will go down, people with especially distinctive voices may be able to make a living off of simply licensing that.

petrichorInk,"To add to this, crypto and especially NFTs are solutions seeking problems they're able to solve. Blockchain technology is over a decade old and outside of very specific niches, there is nothing that blockchain tech can do which existing technology can't. 

However, due to their appeal to investors seeing 'new' technologies and a potential to create new platforms/monopolies and make money outside of regulations (crypto assets is only very recently taxed in the US, etc), investors are seeing a gravy train they want to hop in on and developers are seeing something sexy they can sell to individuals and companies for tons of money for very little effort. 

Most recently, there has been a foray into creating crypto games. It is utterly unnecessary for a game company to create things on the blockchain and many promises hinge on literally unworkable ideas such as interoperability and 'play to earn'. They're imagining casinos where they're the winners, but in a casino, there's always a hundred thousand losers for each winner. A large amount of gamers (and game developers, too) see that NFTs and the blockchain are ultimately, deeply harmful to an industry that's supposed to be about fun and entertainment. 

As a group, they've always been vocal about anti-consumer practices, for example, Diablo 3 had a real money marketplace (which is something that the blockchain claims it can uniquely do, a regular database is already able to do such a thing) which was taken down due to consumer backlash.

Snoo75418,"Answer: There has been a huge increase in Crypto and NFT related games recently with them getting more frequent, and their tactics more questionable. I recommend looking up some videos on Chronicles of Elyria, Earth 2, CryptoLand, and also looking into Ubisoft's recent NFT launch for their AAA game Ghost Recon Breakpoint. There seems to be more of an acceptance as NFTs and Crypto coins being integrated into gaming for some reason, and the only people seemingly playing or buying these NFTs are not Gamers, but mostly Crypto influencers that sometimes call themselves a ""Gamer at heart"" but really all they are there to do is make money. If you do a quick Google search for ""NFT games"" you'll see there's actually quite an expansive list. 

It's becoming worrying to the actual Gaming community that this is going to be like the new Micro-Transactions plague, however some of these ""games"" don't even have a playable version of the game, and yet are still engaging in selling of NFTs for the purpose of this ""game"" that doesn't exist, so there are also very real concerns of Scams.",hsof8jp,t3_s41k2w,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/s41k2w/whats_the_deal_with_gaming_youtubersstreamers_all/hsof8jp/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,
Toloran,"Answer: The ""Metaverse"" is a proposed 'next step' of the internet where instead of just being 2D websites, you have 3D locations in a virtual world.

How that could work could be like Full Dive systems like from Sword Art Online (or any similar anime), full VR (like from books such as Snow Crash), or could instead be more like an MMORPG world (similar to the game Second Life). The tech for such a thing is already *mostly* here for VR, but the market saturation of things like VR headsets isn't quite there yet. However, a few companies (most notably Facebook) are diverting resources into developing it so they can get their foot in the door first and lay claim to that frontier.

The major issue facing it is the platform structure of it. The Internet spread largely because it is decentralized (by design): Even if a specific website/service goes down, you still have full access to the rest of the internet. Similarly, even if a specific local area has issues, that has no effect on the rest of the internet's users.

What Facebook is proposing is closer to something like an MMORPG-style world but built for community and commerce rather than gaming. That's not the classic idea of a ""metaverse"" but it has a big/valuable name behind it (ie, Facebook) and that's enough to bring investors. Toss in some expensive sounding buzzwords like ""NFTs"" and you have techbro investors lining up to throw their money at it so they can ""get in on the ground floor"", so to speak.",hsklloe,t3_s3aoyk,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/s3aoyk/why_have_people_been_talking_about_metaverse/hsklloe/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

GregBahm,"Gamestop has been very quiet about their future plans since they became a memestock.

Before all that happened, when Ryan Cohen first joined up, he said in interviews that Gamestop had a valuable asset in the old ""Powerpass"" subscription Gamestop used to sell. He implied that the years and years of customer sales data Gamestop had collected could be leveraged in some innovative way, just like how he leveraged Petsmart's customer information for Chewy to set up dog grooming appointments and the such.

Since then, Gamestop itself has been aggressively silent on their plans. So the community has come up with some of their own ideas of what Gamestop could do.

One popular idea was using the mall kiosks as e-sports tournament locations, and then sell e-sports merchandise. This idea is especially popular with the competitive console players (mostly Smash Brothers and fighter games) but these markets are extremely small.

Another popular idea is to pivot back to PC hardware, like old computer parts stores like Babbage. This idea is especially popular with PC games, but this market is extremely small (hence PC hardware stores largely going out of business in the 90s.)

Another popular idea is for Gamestop to launch a digital Steam competitor. The challenge with this is that digital storefronts like Steam are themselves struggling. Free-To-Play games are their own little digital storefronts, which is why major corporations like Activision are pivoting away from their own digital storefronts and towards the FTP model. Big single player games are increasingly sold through subscription services like Gamepass, which also eliminates digital storefronts like Steam. There's speculation that Gamestop could offer a ""Netflix for Games"" subscription service like Gamepass, but they're at a competitive disadvantage because Microsoft/Sony/Nintendo can push their own subscriptions directly through their consoles.

So now the hot new idea is NFTs. But there's no coherent idea of how ""embedding a unique link in a blockchain"" makes Gamestop relevant again. Game developers have no interest of transferring their revenue to a middleman like Gamestop again, and selling used digital video games would be like selling used movie tickets. But everyone's understanding of NFTs is evolving. I'm the first to admit there may be so idea here I'm not seeing.

I'm always trying to get someone to explain this concept to me. Selling NFTs as fine art made perfect sense (it's just money laundering) but selling used digital games is such a profoundly bizarre idea.

If ""digital resales"" would increase the net profit of a game developer, because a price drop would increase sales, the game developer might as well just drop the price. It makes no difference to them whether one guy buys a game for $10 or two guys buy the game for $5.

Sterlingz,"It saddens me that so much misinformation still circulates, even from so-called ""experts"". 

&gt; the non-fungible (un-reproduceable) part of NFTs is usually just a receipt pointing to art hosted elsewhere, meaning it's possible for the art to disappear and the NFT becomes functionally useless, pointing to a 404 ‚Äî Page Not Found

Most major NFTs are hosted on Arweave, an on-chain distributed data layer. This tech was used by newspapers China was trying to suppress during the Hong Kong protests. It basically cannot 404.

&gt; Artists who get into NFTs with a sincere hope of making money are often hit with a harsh reality that they're losing more money to minting NFTs of their art is making in profit. (Each individual minted art piece costs about $70-$100 USD to mint)

You seem stuck on the idea of ""minting expensive"", which is so 2020. Ethereum minting is expensive, but PoS chains have captured 80% of users. Transactions on PoS chains are dirt cheap (pennies). You might pay the artist minting costs as well, but artists are entitled to a living, too.

&gt; gamers are angry because game publishers love the idea of using NFTs as a way to squeeze more money out of microtransactions. Buying a digital hat for your character is only worth anything because of artificial scarcity and bragging rights. NFTs bolster both of those

Gamers are missing the point entirely. You don't need NFTs to charge players microtransactions.

&gt; The computational cost of minting NFTs (and verifying blockchain technology on the whole) is very energy intensive, and until our power grids are run with renewables, this means we're burning more coal, more fossil fuels, so that more grifters can grift artists and investors.

Refer to the point above. Computational costs are minimal (cents / couple bucks) on PoS chains.

Dense_Inspector,"Answer: 

Preamble:
NFTs are ""Non-fungible tokens"" what this means is that the token can't be swapped for another token - if I have a dollar, it's worth the same as another dollar and can be swapped. If I have a bored ape NFT, it's not worth the same as any other bored ape NFT. 

Why are they valuable:

Well this is a new technology, the people who beleive in them think these NFTs are a new form of ownership and bored apes are a highly sought after collection so people pay very high prices, because they are ""NFTs"" there's a highly limited supply of the bored apes and so those who beleive (and probably have lots of crypto anyway) pay lots for them. It's like buying a copy of Harry Potter with a serial number 000001, it shows you got in on the ground floor. 

How do they get stolen:
The NFTs are created on the blockchain (based on Ethereum) and are owned by a wallet, and your ""wallet"" which holds your NFTs is accessed using a key. If someone can steal your key, they can open your wallet and send all your valuable NFTs to someone else. Since the blockchain can't reverse transactions like a normal bank, if someone gets your key and transfers your NFTs, they're gone forever. If you lose your key, that's on you - people have thrown away hard disks with bitcoin wallets that are now worth millions. 


What does stolen even mean for a NFT of a picture:

The NFT is *not* the picture. There is a picture, the copyright holder of the picture creates an NFT which represents ""ownership"" of the picture. The NFT is actually some peice of data which points to a certain URL and is held by an account. The NFT is meant to represent more than just having a copy of a picture, it's meant to represent ownership. It is not clear if the courts would uphold this. 


Why do they get dunked on:


The *whole point* of cryptocurrencies is that you hold your own stuff. It's up to you. There's no bank looking after you, you're totally free, but you're totally on your own. So if you fuck up and have bad security and lose your stuff, it's totally on you.

Right now there is a strange cultural meme called the ""Fear of missing out"". It is a sensation that you don't want regrets for not jumping in early while the meme culture is still there.


It is strong in the current crypto bubble because people have really bad hindsight fallacy and see their lack of commitment and risk taking as the reason why they aren't bitcoin billionaires.


And it is happening with a new bubble around NFTs.

Crypto and stock people may make a lot of money in an intangible way - something that isn't super liquid or spend able, and all exists as numbers in a web dashboard. Part of this culture is strong validation seeking of their new easy-come-easy-go wealth. That is why there are big and strong echo chambers on reddit and elsewhere.

Combine the desire to have tangible representations of wealth (like gold bugs) with the desire to not miss out (hype chasing) and you have a perfect storm of buying expensive meme items.

Why tungsten cubes? Because they are made and you can order them online, they don't serve a purpose, rare in everyday life (hypeable) and they are an unusual experience. Plus they have some intrinsic and curiosity value so maybe they are some insurance against the crypto bubble popping. And because it is a nontraditional metal for collecting or wealth storage, to them, it is more subculture cool than something like gold.

NoahDiesSlowly,"I come from a design background. We're taught to solve problems. A common pitfall for designers is finding a solution without a problem, and latching onto it. Such designers will try to work backwards from a solution to a problem it may solve. Not only does this approach virtually always fail, it almost always involves the ego and provides a haven of misapplication.

I haven't been provided with a convincing blockchain project to this day. I was super onboard with cryptocurrency until I found out about the energy footprint and high adoption from centralized institutions.

For cryptocurrency, I see nothing but erasure of accountability and high adoption from centralized institutions looking to decentralize (but not weaken) their influence. It also creates a tech ownership barrier to the very act of owning currency, which basically wipes homeless people off the map unless we continue to use cash post-adoption. Any issues we have with current FIAT systems is made worse with the lack of accountability.

Think about it. Your average taxpayer is not worried about anonymity of transactions or degrees of centralization. They buy eggs and potatoes and they don't care if anyone knows they did. The people who really care are the corporations who want (more than anything) to avoid implication in laundering, lobbying, bribes, and funding. These are the people who will benefit most from anonymity of transactions.

Put another way, if the FBI knew you were buying potatoes, would you care? If the FBI knew every purchase you every made would they give a shit? Probably not. Even if some of it is illegal, they probably have bigger fish to fry. The people with true skin in the game have much more than potatoes and weed on the table.

For NFTs, I see nothing but a new avenue for digital rights management (DRM). I have yet to be provided with a design problem which is elegantly solved with the highly specific mix of non-fungibility and 100% online public records. Most ideas which skirt the idea are better suited to simple nonfungibility (which has been around for decades).

Medical applications are better suited to non-public records. We don't want people's medical data browsable by just everyone. Additionally, in medical fields lack of verifiability only hurts the patient. If a patient or doctor wishes to misrepresent a medical issue, it only hurts the patient or the doctor. Since both of their incentives are aligned (see: health) non-fungibility, nor public records, help either character.

Videogames have been using non-fungibility for decades, in order to enforce one copy of a game per customer. It has failed dramatically. Pirates will simply bypass the check on a fundamental level by repacking the game code to work without such DRM. Additionally, customers' experiences are only be worsened by making the playing of a game require more verification steps.

The only applications I see for nonfungible tokens with freely visible public records, is the application of digital commerce, which I think is comprehensively a grift meant to squeeze scarcity out of places it didn't previously exist.

Some will see dollar signs with this revelation, and those people are capitalist parasites. By which I mean they provide nothing of value and expect returns.

I'm happy to be presented with an elegant application but the fact none have showed up in all my years of dealing with NFT pundits somewhat kneecaps the idea. It's a solution looking for a problem in my opinion.

These questions highlight a common problem with NFTs/blockchain: the blockchain technology is great at proving ownership within its own system, but it's *useless* when it comes to any issues outside of the blockchain.

The NFT itself (the thing you're actually buying, a record that contains a URL pointing to the image) is stored ""on-chain"". This means that everyone who's using that blockchain (iirc, the apes are all on the Ethereum blockchain) has a copy of the NFT in their copies of the blockchain; a record is stored for every transaction is stored by every user forever, so if you sell your NFT then every user adds a record into their copy saying ""you sold this monkey picture to this other person"".

Depends on what you mean by the NFT. If you mean the NFT itself (i.e. the receipt), it's part of the data in the blockchain, so it's stored on every machine taking part in it. If you mean the thing it points to, then it's stored on someone's server somewhere, so it could (and in some cases, has, IIRC) get taken down",hqv98af,t1_hqv3pjo,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/rtunm7/whats_going_on_with_the_stolen_nft_apes_bored_ape/hqv98af/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

yuefairchild,"Answer: [A new years' message from the CEO of Square-Enix](https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/2022/html/a_new_years_letter_from_the_president_2.html) says they want to implement NFTs in their future games.

NFTs, AKA non-fungible tokens, are virtual collectibles. The NFT itself is a string of text stored on a blockchain - Usually Etherium or Dogecoin. It'll say something like ""http://example.address.top/YsayleSteppingOnMe.png is currently owned by /u/Yuefairchild."" And the idea is that I'm now the legal owner of YsayleSteppingOnMe.png...except not really, because I can't control how the image is shared or monetize it in any way. It just has my name on the receipt. It's kind of like that scam where you sell someone naming rights to a designated star in space, but no one keeps track of those records, and if the company goes under, so does any proof that this star is yours.

While it's tough to generalize gamers, they're generally opposed to NFTs, seeing them as overpriced scams. NFT owners believe this ownership-without-ownership is the future of all media and that NFTs are a great investment, since you never know when one might go viral and become worth millions of dollars. They don't have a lot of details on how the owner of said NFT would access that money, other than selling it to another collector.

Since cryptocurrency drains a lot of electricity to sustain itself, you could say summoning NFTs is a scheme to bleed the land dry of its vital energy to suit the whims of a few powerful assholes that are about a billion years old. This sort of plotline is typical of Final Fantasy games, so the picture (a photoshop of Final Fantasy VII, where eco-terrorist leader Barrett lectures protagonist Cloud strife about the climate crisis they're trying to deal with, but in the game he only says, ""The planet's dyin', Cloud."") ironically paints Square-Enix as the villains of their own story.",hqv0c32,t3_rtqiib,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/rtqiib/whats_going_on_with_square_enix/hqv0c32/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,
Wildbow,"Answer: Square Enix's president wrote a new years' letter that embraced Facebook's (very contentious) change over to 'the Metaverse', NFTs, and blockchain games.  Facebook's Metaverse relabeling was, to him, ""evidence that the concept is not a mere buzzword but here to stay"" and that this attention caused 2021 to be dubbed the ""Metaverse Year.""

**NFTs** - Ask yourself what the distinction is between owning the Mona Lisa and owning a digital poster with the Mona Lisa printed on it.  Obviously there's parts of it that can be dated, authenticated, etc.  Well... what happens if you draw a cool piece of digital art?  How do you own the original in the modern world?  NFTs were something of an attempt at creating a digital record (enforced through blockchain) that gets extended perpetually as a history of ownership, and verified through hard computation.

What they've become, however, is something of a buzzword and hypebeast, where people think they're buying art but they're really buying the ability to say ""My name's on the receipt""... where that receipt isn't necessarily tied to the object in question.  When you're buying an NFT proclaiming to be tied to the Mona Lisa, there's really no association.  You're buying a link to a site that may go down, leading to your investment going bankrupt.  This risk is notable, because as with many noveau technologies, the hype surrounding blockchain, bitcoin, and now NFTs, there's a lot of money flying around as people try to get in on &amp; profit from the hype.

Many of these people are annoying, there's a lot of scammers (in essence, this is a nigh-literal ""I have a bridge to sell you""), and there's a lot of misunderstanding where people do think they're getting the rights to the art, instead of the receipt of claim.  NFTs only value is in the value we associate with it.  

To top it off, the calculations involved in NFTs are intensive and primarily use graphics cards.  This produces a lot of wasted energy and (as pertains to Square Enix and gaming), a vastly increased cost in the average high-end graphics card.  Frustrating to many.

**Blockchain Games**

Some companies have made forays into pushing NFTs into gaming (say, letting gamers put real-world money into obtaining the receipt to a specific outfit combination).  Earlier in 2021, it should be noted that Steam banned blockchain games.  Square Enix seems intent on embracing this.  

**Metaverse**

Facebook is a company with a history of rights abuses, misuse of data, and more or less unchecked misuse by terrorists, child pornographers, dangerous political elements, and spreaders of misinformation.  The Metaverse relabeling is widely seen as an attempt to disassociate their name from past behavior, while their current behavior does nothing to distance itself.

SanityInAnarchy,"&gt; The thing that would prevent them is the contract and/or reputational damage. The same things that prevent the Apple Store from just deleting 100% of my apps and laughing maniacally.

That's an interesting choice of analogy, for two reasons: First, the Apple store works fine without a blockchain, and second, they absolutely *do* delete apps.

One of my favorite examples of this kind of thing: Because of some licensing issue, Amazon was forced to remove *Nineteen Eighty-Four* from the Kindle store. And because of how the Kindle store works, they ultimately went and deleted it from people's Kindles and sent them a refund. (The Kindle store managed to survive even the reputational damage of sending something as ironic as *Nineteen Eighty-Four* down the Memory Hole.)

&gt; NFT's don't solve that problem, but they do allow the database of contracts to live in a multi-party marketplace instead of just on a single company's servers.

Right, but it relies 100% on those companies cooperating. If you can get them to cooperate, you don't need a blockchain to do it. If you can't, a blockchain doesn't fix it.

&gt; Once again, that comes down to the contracts that the original artwork was ""sold"" with in the first place. The NFTs don't solve that problem, certainly, but the fact that the original creator can be incentivized to let you treat the objects as ""property"" (due to taking a cut of resales) implies that they may also be incentivized to make your property available to you in a useful form.

Maybe. Or they might be incentivized to allow as many resales as possible, while still keeping this 'property' in their own walled garden. I think that's more likely, because we already have markets for trading things like TF2 hats, yet it never seems to have occurred to Valve to license those hats for use in Overwatch or Destiny or anything else. NFTs aren't necessary to make an arrangement like that work, so why hasn't it happened before now?

This also assumes it's zero work ever if you have the proper licensing. Just about everything beyond a simple mesh is going to have a ton of engine-specific stuff in it, especially when you start getting into animation systems and shaders. I don't think it's an accident that the closest we have to a marketplace like this is Second Life, which ties all of it to a single game engine and a single set of MMO servers run by a single company.",hqdp7yo,t1_hqdei0p,/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/rqe04v/whats_going_on_with_gamestop_and_crypto/hqdp7yo/,1,OutOfTheLoop,t5_2xinb,r/OutOfTheLoop,0,,,

prescod,"&gt;The creators of the Ethereum blockchain do not own all of the value of Ethereum. 

Exactly. That's exactly the whole point. Nor do they own all of the ""say"" in what direction Ethereum goes. In fact the ""say"" is owned by the coalition of miners and programmers.

Invalidating a specific contract requires the programmers to change the Ethereum code base and then the miners to deploy the new code.

Changing the code to mess with a specific contract between EA and Gamestop is basically unthinkable. It would cause a huge rupture in the community. The last time it was done was in 1996 because 4% of ALL of the Ethereum in the world was stolen by an unknown hacker.

&gt;Even so, just because you're rich doesn't mean that you're immune to influence and bribes.

Do you know how difficult and controversial it is for the creators of Ethereum to intervene in the economy? They've done it exactly once in the history of the platform and it is still a huge humiliation to them that they had to do it. You seem to think it's some small thing they can do secretly.

&gt;Gold is a rare resource is extremely useful in practical terms and very beautiful to look at, and the Gutenberg Bible is both extremely rare and well made with a massive amount of historical significance. Comparing video game NFTs to these two items is nonsensical.

You're using words like ""beautiful"", ""well made"" and ""rare"". Do you see how those words are entirely subjective? Lots of people are more interested in cool Valorant skins than the Gutenberg bible. You can try to tell them that their preferences are ""nonsensical"" but it's actually kind of ""nonsensical"" for you to try and dictate to other people what they consider beautiful, noteworthy or valuable.

&gt;They do that to encourage people to visit their stores and buy other things. If you're already bringing over a large library of items, you're a lot less likely to make additional purchases.

SanityInAnarchy,"I think this still applies, though:

&gt; It is perhaps also relevant to mention that this sort of ""ownership"" enabled by NFTs could also be supported by traditional centralized databases. Yes, they could suddenly decide to restrict the trade of assets in this scenario, but in the NFT scenario, they could also restrict which receipts they recognize.

In other words, the NFT *tech* adds basically nothing to this equation -- nothing is stopping Activision from allowing you to sell skins (or games) and collecting a percentage of the sale. In fact, there are already marketplaces that do this!

NFTs add buzzwords and a massive carbon footprint, but they don't actually change the equation.

Oh, also:

&gt; Let's say you design a COD skin (following the proper design specifications) and get it licensed by Activision (like making and selling an app on the app store).

flanderguitar,"LONDON, March 29 (Reuters) - Blockchain project Ronin said on Tuesday that hackers stole cryptocurrency now worth almost $615 million from its systems, in what would be one of the largest cryptocurrency heists on record.

The project said that unidentified hackers on March 23 stole some 173,600 ether tokens and 25.5 million USD Coin tokens. At current exchange rates, the stolen funds are worth $615 million, but they were worth some $540 million at the time of the attack.

This makes it the second-largest crypto theft on record, according to blockchain analysis firm Elliptic.

Ronin is used to power the popular online game Axie Infinity, which uses non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and is the biggest NFT collection by all-time sales volume, according to NFT market tracker CryptoSlam.

Ronin said in a blog post that the hacker had used stolen private keys - the passwords needed to access crypto funds - to make off with the funds.

Ronin said it had discovered the hack on Tuesday. ""We are working directly with various government agencies to ensure the criminals get brought to justice,"" it said, adding that it was discussing with Axie Infinity how to ensure no users' funds were lost.

Ronin's users are unable to withdraw or deposit funds on the network, it said.

Ronin did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent via Twitter. It said it was working with major blockchain tracker Chainalysis to trace the stolen funds. Most of the funds are still in the hacker's digital wallet, Ronin said.

Hacks have long plagued crypto platforms.

The cryptocurrency arm of Jump Trading said last month it had restored more than $320 million to crypto platform Wormhole after the decentralised finance site was hit with one of the largest crypto heists on record. read more

Last August, hackers behind likely the biggest ever digital coin heist returned nearly all of the $610 million-plus they stole from the DeFi site Poly Network. read more

In 2018, digital tokens worth some $530 million were stolen from Tokyo-based platform Coincheck. Mt. Gox, another Japanese exchange, collapsed in 2014 after hackers stole half a billion dollars of crypto.

It's a different crisis than 2008, but that doesn't make it any less severe.

You're right that this is different. 2008 led to a market collapse, a huge transition of wealth from the poor to the rich, and a general distrust in large institutions that resulted in bullshit populist pyramid schemes like crypto and NFTs.

TavisNamara,"Not really. Amazon stock is actually connected to something. That is, Amazon. It is a piece of the corporation. The value may fluctuate, but it's tied to something very real, if intangible. In the future, Amazon may even offer dividends- a tangible compensation for ownership based on the profit of the company. But regardless, there is a real thing that it's connected to, and confers control of that portion of the company. I'm a very, very minor stockholder (a few hundred in two companies- almost nothing, really) myself and get a letter every once in a while instructing me on how to submit my votes for all sorts of things and, were I a larger shareholder, I could have significant influence on the company. And the regulators and governments back the idea that my shares mean something, and the whole system acknowledges that yes, I own a portion- tiny as it is- of those companies. But crypto and NFTs are, by their nature, not really anything? Especially crypto. It's all a fiction that has value because we say it has value. There's no company with tangible assets out there. There's no regulation stating there's a connection. There's nothing but a crypto wallet stating you technically have a thing. What is that thing? Not much. What good is it if the creators do a rug pull? Useless. What happens if nobody's buying? You lose.

That said, much of the value of stocks is indeed fictional- but again, it *is* tied to something real that can't just spontaneously vanish. Which gives it a critical level of stability and base value that crypto and NFTs can literally never have.

Also, for the record, I fucking hate the companies I own shares in and always vote against them being assholes.

True. 

However, since crypto/NFTs are apt to capital gains as they are seen as a security not a currency, the losses on any investment can offset gains. This is especially true in crypto, you could have NFTs that ""make money"" and NFTs that are ""losses"" but the offset or margin between those is only what is taxed.

Additionally, buying them for any business purpose can be an expense that lowers tax burden.  

Buying an NFT where the funds go to another company that is partly owned by you or associates, that is taxed differently and not directly, can move taxation or lower it.

YellowB,"Imagine you spend your entire life being a good person. You spend the weekends helping out at the homeless shelter. During the day time you tutor the disabled kids at the local YMCA. You eat healthy and exercise regularly so that you can meet the right person one day and start a family. Pictures of your wedding day, having your first kid, seeing them graduate all flash in your mind through out the day. Why just yesterday you made your last payment and have finally paid off your student loan.   

 To celebrate you offered to meet a friend at the coffee shop, that you really like and finally have the heart to ask out. They agree to meet you that day. You get on your bike and drive it to get to the Cafe. After about 3 miles of riding your bike you have only 3 more minutes to reach your destination.  You ride your bike over the bridge, when all of the sudden you feel the entire Earth start shifting. You have no idea what's going on but you hop off your bike to keep your balance. Almost immediately that flat surface is now almost at a 45 degree incline.  You grab whatever you can to hang on as you wsee your bike slide backwards into a gap in the pavement that is widening. You shout for help but you know that no one will be able to help you now that you're 60 feet in the air. You wonder how any of this can happen to you. You've been a good person your entire life and were just about to start a relationship.   

Seconds later your fingers give out from the pain of holding on for so long. You finally give in and look to the right where the control tower is. The last few seconds of your life you see the guy in charge of the bridge on his phone, trying to browse /r/Wallstreetbets to get tips on which NFT to invest his life savings on.

Squirrel_Inner,"Wow, dude sure likes to talk. Maybe next time you send someone that link, mention that he doesn't start on his point with NFTs until the 40min mark.  
He really could have split that up into 3 separate vids, or maybe just been more succinct instead of rambling on and on.

Here's his main points (as far as I could manage to understand) with my replies:  
	1) NFTs are bad because crypto uses them and crypto is bad.   
	My response: NFTs don't have to use crypto. Yes, there are a lot of scams going on, that's true for literally everything. Following hype is bad (dumb), but there is more to it than that.

	2) Current NFT marketplaces are bad and there are too many privacy concerns.  
	My response: Correct, which is why we need a better one. The fact that some people misuse a thing doesn't mean it should be completely abandoned. Are we going to go back to trading sheep because criminals use money laundering practices?

  
	3) At 1:34:00 he finally gets to the point about actual NFTs as a valuable commodity. His reply: we don't know that's going to happen and the market makers could be bad.  
  
So that whole spiel could pretty much be summed up as: crypto uses NFT and most crypto is a scam, therefore NFTs are bad. The good uses of NFTs haven't happened yet, therefore NFTs are bad.  
(This did not require 2 hrs of rambling.)  
  
The expansion into the western frontier was chaotic, full of criminals and little real law, but because that happened does that mean that human expansion is inherently bad? Should the U.S. put a cap on how many children people should have, stop building, and claim that all future expansion will only create the same problems as the Wild West? His counterfactuals have no merit, because he is basing all of it on the worst case scenario, instead of actually thinking that someone could do something good with it.

&gt; IRS investigators seized $3.5 billion worth of cryptocurrencies tied to financial crimes during fiscal year 2021, a figure that accounted for 93% of all the assets seized by the division in that time frame. IRS CI ended the year with 80 cases in its inventory that it was still actively working where the primary violation was tied to crypto, Korner said.

&gt;Law enforcement agencies are worried about a range of criminal activities. They worry when they see people paying millions of dollars for assets, like NFTs, that don‚Äôt seem to have that kind of inherent value, Korner said.

hcschild,"&gt; Arguably any fault of crypto, with respect to bad actors, money has the same, minus any form of tracing at all. So any points of it being ‚Äúbetter‚Äù at ‚Äúbad things‚Äù is not a valid argument.
&gt; 

That's correct everything bad you can do you can do with money or crypto.

&gt; ‚ÄúAccording to the UN, it is estimated that between 2% and 5% of global GDP ($1.6 to $4 trillion) annually is connected with money laundering and illicit activity. This means that criminal activity using cryptocurrency transactions is much smaller than fiat currency and its use is going down year by year.‚Äù

You can't replace the illegal crypto once it got tainted. That most illegal stuff happens with real money makes sense because crypto is used at the moment mostly on darknet market places that only make a tiny fraction of all illegal activities. You still have the problem auf tainting the money from it or when it gets stolen.

&gt;You think it costs more money and energy to use Bitcoin vs. the current financial industry complex? Not even close.

Sorry but that's one of the most shitty articles I've ever seen... Bitcoin had about 400,000 daily transactions in January last year. The Credit Card Visa Network alone has about 150,000,000 daily transactions... So Bitcoin uses about half the energy of the banking system with not even close to 1% of the transactions... And that doesn't include other banking transactions and credit cards. 

&gt;Understanding that not all are fans of PoW‚Ä¶there are other energy friendlier methods.

It would work if we had unlimited energy and resources but we don't. :\\

&gt;As for payments, the rails that run Visa and Mastercard, globally, can accommodate 70,000 transactions per second, they may be able to increase that to 100,000. Bitcoin can only do 7, but Lightning Network increase that to 1,000,000. Again, if you‚Äôre not a BTC fan, there are other very impressive technologies in the space as well.

Ok maybe I should have read this before I've answered the above part but my point still stands. :) The Lightning Network brings  other problems with it like fraud and traceability issues. 

Yes there are a lot of interesting ideas but at the moment many of them are only used to speculate on them or scam people. Most are holding crypto to use it as an investment and not because they want to use it as a currency. It's the same with NFTs, an interesting idea but at the moment mostly used for MLM and other scams.",huf0dav,t1_hudsrar,/r/news/comments/scq4vy/drop_bitcoin_as_legal_tender_imf_urges_el_salvador/huf0dav/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,0,,,

hcschild,"&gt;The only other way is through an ATM, which has its limits.

Not really you can find someone who will get you cash, gold or something else of value. When you get to amounts where this isn't feasible anymore you will have to do the same like any other illegal operation and do money laundering. 

&gt;You‚Äôre forgetting that there is a blockchain record of your transactions, even the ones where Bitcoin seemingly mysteriously appears in your account. If audited, you‚Äôd have to answer for that.

And? It's not like illegal money gets laundered all the time. Set up a business that accepts bitcoin and let it do legitimate sales like maybe... Sell your own NFTs! So many people are paying stupid money at the moment for them so why shouldn't you be able to launder your illegally earnt money with some NFTs. Buy them from a handful of different sources (including your own NFTs). Now your NFT wallet has some crypto without any proof that you are the person who bought them. Yes you will loose money doing it this way but that always the case when you do money laundering.

You can't ban every bitcoin that was used for something illegal because that would make over time a huge portion of it unusable, also it would make the whole decentralised feature a joke. 

&gt; How is this ‚Äúworse‚Äù than money again?

When it's the currency of a stable country? Nearly everything. It costs more money and energy to use bitcoin and just looking at the course of bitcoin from last year to now only shows that it's a completely invalid currency to do business with. It's acting like an unregulated stock and not like a stable currency.

Harabeck,"&gt; NFTs will be used as currency by companies in the same way they issue store credit.

Why would they be NFTs though? They're not meant to be currency. Wouldn't they offer fungible tokens on a store specific chain or something?

&gt;  It also takes fiat out of that equation and would make the crypto it‚Äôs based on the medium of exchange.

And that improves *nothing*. The block chain is so horrible at managing transactions that you have to take transactions off the blockchain to get them done in a reasonable time, which opens you up to all sorts of scams.

&gt; And here‚Äôs a nice write up on how NFTs can change ticket sales. Ticket Sales

The only thing that article talks about that is specific to NFTs is being able to resale the ticket after the event (and also making the ticket verification more complicated lol). Even their claim that digital tickets aren't unique isn't necessarily true. They could grant unique serial numbers on current digital tickets. Also, organizers can grant perks to ticket holders *right now*, digital or not. And I love how it claims that it will stop bots from buying the legit tickets, but there's nothing to actually stop that. And if people buy tickets from fake websites, how does that change with NFT's?

Well, we quickly found out people are ok downloading a lower quality sound for free. The response from the music industry was to sue people who downloaded and shared songs on Napster , eventually it became unsustainable and it had to adapt by selling single songs online and create an entire infrastructure that eventually turned into the MAAS (Music as a service) model we're familiar with: Spotify, Pandora, etc...

People are building them ""because they can"" but they're not particularly functional and leave a lot of people saying ""why?""

With that being said, NFTs can represent digital rights and ownership that, because they're connected with a deposit address, can be paid out on the fly.

Artists could literally stake or sell the backend or rights through NFT minting. Not only that, but licensing deals and copyright usage doesn't have to grind to a halt for a licensing dispute or sale to be resolved. Both can happen independently.

This is one example of a use case and a lot of cool things can happen with NFT representation pointing back to a payment address.

It's not about the stupid pictures of stupid monkeys that makes the concept mostly a solution in search of a problem.

I can see it being a component of self-executing contracts -- but there is a huge paradigm shift that would be required in the world's legal systems before self-executing contracts become more than a novelty or a very narrow niche use case.  It's intrinsic to the nature of a contract that the validity of the contract itself can be called into question.  The law has to have a mechanism by which a contract ***can be stopped*** before it executes -- and in some cases can be rescinded even after the contract is no longer executory.  

This is not a question of making contract law ready for self-execution.  It's fixing self-execution so that it's ready to become a creature of law.  Human beings make mistakes, act maliciously and act against their own self-interest when pushed to extremes -- and contracts law reflects this and has centuries of built-in safeguards.  The blockchain is sexy and shiny, but a thousand years of institutional wisdom isn't going to just be swept away because a bunch of narrow-minded linear-thinking nerds think it fixes anything.

Your argument gets really abstract to go into ""what is value? Or purpose? Or things? Or meaning?"".

Mr_Blinky,"&gt;You think we'll be using nation state based cash in 20 years?

...yes? Absolutely. Duh. You think the major world governments are going to allow a *decentralized currency* to take away their leverage over markets, their control over inflation and deflation? No way in hell. The only reason crypto exists in the form it *currently* does is because up to this point there's been nothing to really spend it on aside from drugs on shady-ass websites, and governments haven't really bothered to crack down on it before now. The entire reason NFTs exist is basically because some cryptobros realized there was nothing to actually spend cryptocurrency on to convince people to buy into more crypto, so they came up with a scam where you get to ""own"" something ""real"" with it to give it an air of legitimacy. The second crypto starts becoming a major economic player outside of speculative markets and actually starts impacting the real world I can guarantee it's going to get fucking *smashed* by regulation.

Crypto is likely here to stay, but crypto as it currently exists on the chain is never going to be anything more than a gimmick, unless the tech bros behind it somehow manage to convince a bunch of other hypercapitalist techbros that they can all make a shitload of money off exploiting the market.

TavisNamara,"There's a huge list of reasons why this isn't going to work out, and my initial response to you vanished spontaneously for some reason (I clicked off to do something else and when I looked back my reply had simply vanished, 90% complete...), so I'm gonna just give you the short version from some copy-pastes of why both NFTs and crypto in general are a massive scam that, if it ever catches on, will only fuck us over more.

1:

Creating artificial scarcity as a design goal, which is very counter to the idea of a free and open web of information. This makes the privatization of the web easier. Using that artificial scarcity to drive a speculation market then hurts most people except hedge funds, grifters, and the extremely lucky.

2: 

NFTs are not rights. They never have been, and never will be. They are *a receipt*. In order for that receipt to have literally any value, that receipt has to be acknowledged as legitimate. There are exactly two groups who currently think those receipts are legitimate: Scammers and crypto bros. And the scammers are very, very selective in which ones they consider legitimate. Specifically: Theirs.

3:

&gt;The most damning dealbreaker (to me) for cryptocurrencies is that the biggest adopters of cryptocurrencies currently are banks, hedge funds, and daytraders. The people who got in on the ground floor of cryptocurrencies are the mega-rich capitalists. The people profiting most from the so-called democratization / decentralization of finance are centralized banks, rich fucks, scammers, launderers. Those are the people who are benefiting most, and do you think that's gonna change if cryptocurrencies become world standard? I do not. Rather, I think if cryptocurrencies were to become world standard, those rich fucks would've long-since secured themselves as kings. Just kings of a different currency. I would argue they already control cryptocurrency, even if some lucky DOGE buyers got rich on a fluke. Also, this time everyone's names are hidden from the transaction records, whoops! Good luck legislating that away when the big lobbyists all have a vested interest in keeping their lobbying hidden from the eyes of the public!

It is a simple fact that everything that can currently be done with crypto and NFTs can be done better by using pre-existing methods, with the singular potential exception of scamming people. It will never be what you want it to be.",hswmjsp,t1_hswdwd0,/r/news/comments/s58fp0/panic_as_kosovo_pulls_the_plug_on_its/hswmjsp/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,0,,,

But NFTs are actually the rights to that nonsense, moreso than just the nonsense itself. There are potentially bigger applications for that tech, such as music and media purchasing. Instead of buying a copy of a song or movie on itunes like you did 10 years ago, an artist could mint up and sell a million NFTs for a new song, and fans could literally purchase and own that song, while an artist can also avoid a bunch of third party, profiteering middleman bullshit.

And (imho) it is this goal which still holds absolute relevance in our modern world, even more so after 40 years of neoliberal economics: The last 40 years saw a accelerated aggregation of wealth in a very small number of people/families and this wealth/power will be inherited. 

The french clergy and nobility made up about 1% of frances population at the eve of the french revolution,  the top 1% of the richest US americans now own a third of the US american wealth. Thus we have already a third of US wealth in the hands of a proto-feudal cast which will only strengthen the position of these families and make it harder for the general populance.

BigSwedenMan,"Princess Diana bears are worth virtually nothing these days (even though some people are still trying to get thousands of dollars for them, you can get one for only a couple bucks if you look). I was comparing NFTs to beanie babies because what they basically are is a collectable that's currently being treated as an investment. That creates an artificial demand that only lasts as long as the craze. Most people aren't actually interested in collecting them, they're interested in buying them and reselling them at a profit, to other people who are doing the exact same thing. Just look at the way you're taking about it. You're not talking about how cool it is to own the NFT, you're talking purely about how you can make money off of them.


It's exactly what happened with beanie babies. Once they hit a critical saturation point and people couldn't sell at a profit, they began dumping what they had. The result is that a flood of beanies hit the market all at once, and because nobody was buying them as an investment anymore they couldn't sell them. Supply goes way up, demand goes way down. 

The fact that you can verify it's the original is a moot point because the product it's verifying has no real value. You don't even own the rights over what you have the NFT of, you literally just own a few bits in the blockchain",hsa543m,t1_hs9v0f6,/r/news/comments/rxhetz/crypto_scammers_took_a_record_14_billion_in_2021/hsa543m/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,0,,,
point_breeze69,"I would need to go to a third party to get it authenticated otherwise I‚Äôm only relying on a strangers word that it is what they say it is. Then I would have to get insurance on it in case it got damaged en route to me and it loses the 9.7 grading. Then once I have it I will need to find some place to keep it safe and make sure it doesn‚Äôt degrade over time and if I ever wanted to resell it I would have to go through the same process as I did for buying it, dealing with third parties, identifying buyers, paying middleman fees.....

NFTs don‚Äôt have any of these issues. If someone has an authentic Banksy NFT I can verify it by checking the transaction hash, I can purchase it automatically without worrying about escrow or counter-party risk, I don‚Äôt need to worry about degradation of item or loss of it en route to me. I can easily store it in a hardware wallet and if I want to resell it I just put it up on a marketplace.....and I can do this all on my couch in my slippers if I want. 

Also if I want to I can use the Banksy NFT as collateral for a loan or utilizing and turn it into a yield-bearing asset using a defi protocol. I could lease it for passive income or I could fractionalize it and sell parts of it off. And if I wanted to I could sell it and require a percentage of every re-sell that Banksy NFT makes in perpetuity. 

We are only in the early days of NFTs still, the innovation will continue at lightning pace and composability and utility will only increase over time making it much more clear how much greater of an incentive there is to use NFTs for everything.

specialistdeluxe,"NFT's (as we know them images/gifs/videos) in my opinion don't really have any value outside of novelty and i don't know why people would pay money for them lol. 

That said, the technology itself could be and probably is super valuable depending on its implementation. For example IPFS protocol used in a lot of NFTs (the 'link' to the image) acts like a decentralized FTP, where you fetch info from a repository of data. An example of using that protocol would be something like like bittorrent, where a complete chunk of data is comprised of a bunch of pieces of data spread amongst a ton of servers, but instead of those being 'peer to peer' like bitorrent they're spread amongst the blockchain. 

Another example I've read is things like digital licensing, which NFTs (as we know them) are sort of attempting to do, but really poorly. An example of this is something like users owning partial rights to music using NFT's as contracts. I'm butchering the explanation but check out [opulous](https://opulous.org/). Basically crowdsourcing funding and/or licensing via NFT. 

Yet another example is something like [https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en](https://foldingathome.org/?lng=en) where they use pooled resources (idle computers basically) via NFT (not sure how technically) to crunch massive sets of complex scientific data. This was a big thing in working on the covid vaccine i believe. 

Another thread (can't find it) a guy mentioned how useful and powerful it could be for things like SSO and cybersecurity implementations. 

So, my point is people think of 'NFTs' as either money laundering or rich people buying useless digital imagery, when underneath the hood it's got a ton of really interesting technical uses.",hrl01lm,t1_hrkwkct,/r/news/comments/rxhsgn/thieves_steal_gallery_owners_multimilliondollar/hrl01lm/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,0,,,

Avatar_exADV,"There's one really good use for blockchain - to transfer digital currency in transactions which wouldn't be legal if transacted through the banking network.

If you can't use a bank because you're a criminal, bitcoin is a lot better than hauling around a suitcase full of cash. Sure, you don't have legal recourse if your bitcoin gets jacked, but you're a criminal and don't have legal recourse if your -cash- gets jacked. At least with cryptocurrency, your security problems don't include ""the cops pulled me over and want to search my car!""

Of course, ""criminal"" is one of those things that depends on the local laws, so I can't blame, for example, a rich Chinese guy saying ""I should get bitcoin and get my assets out of the reach of a confiscatory government!""

But if you're conducting legal transactions, using an actual bank is far better, because you get the attendant legal protections associated with doing so. Banks aren't perfectly regulated, but they're way, way better regulated than a crypto exchange (and if the bank goes completely out of business, the government will insure your deposits, but Uncle Sam sure as hell will not insure your NFTs.)",hrjav5c,t1_hrj3wap,/r/news/comments/rxhsgn/thieves_steal_gallery_owners_multimilliondollar/hrjav5c/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,0,,,

Try to tie them to anything that physically exists, or otherwise has utility outside of the blockchain ecosystem, and the whole ownership metaphor just doesn't work. It's fine if a blockchain link just fades into the ether, but *somebody* is going to be physically living in that house or land, regardless of what the NFT says, and so either you have some central trusted authority capable of modifying the blockchain's meaning, in which case what the fuck was the point of all the decentralization nonsense when it's just bottlenecked through a centralized entity anyway, or it becomes gradually out of sync with reality, as ownership of the physical and digital version of more and more goods becomes disconnected from each other. In fact, the more you look at claims of NFTs with real utility, the more you realize that *any* utility they can provide *must necessarily* flow through some central authority that promises to provide that utility.

WintersEnvoy,"Its happening in stocks too lol, and its a big big driver for crypto and NFTs. The real money is diversifying everywhere (there was a reddit post about literally the pokemon card market suffering from this, magic the gathering is the same).

But idk if its fomo. The argument is that the economy cant crash in such a serious manner as it did before. The government simply doesnt allow it to let failing companies fail because millions of people losing their jobs is a cascading effect. The stock and housing market staying up is just a byproduct by the implication of that (no risk, only reward, having cash is dumb, so dumb that *rich* people even invest in crypto or NFTs) which have no serious longterm value for the most part. And the burden of upholding this system is anyone who doesnt have a lot of wealth, I couldnt tell you where the line is drawn, 100k? 200, maybe 500k? Anyone who doesnt at least have 100k is losing out bigtime because of inflation increases and wage stagnation which was already bad before the last few years.

For a bubble pop to happen I can think of 2 serious arguments as to why.

1. The interest rates are finally taken up to match or go over inflation rates ([as has been historical...](https://www.gzeromedia.com/the-graphic-truth-50-years-of-us-inflation-vs-interest-rates) That simply wont happen. Because no government is going to pop their own bubble simple as that, its so massive, so many would lose their jobs and homes and entire banks would probably collapse and that leads to people losing their savings and all kinds of issues, cascading effects.
2. The debt becomes so large compared to economies that bonds almost entirely stop being purchased. This is basically impossible, because no one really buys bonds already since the return rates are so objectively bad. Current bonds are bought by the average worker via government institutions (social security), since they are controlled by the government. Anyone who has money in social security is losing money due to inflation because bonds are shit. So the government cant really run out of money to loan because its a hidden tax thats supposed to pay peoples retirements, which becomes impossible when inflations are going up for the same reason (money printing), and bonds pay less than inflations going up (hasnt happened in most economies the last 60 years).
3. Bonus reason: governments come to their senses and realize this is unsustainable, and a big economic downturn now is probably better than mass riots protests and political turmoil in 10-30 years because a big portion of the working or retired population wont be able to afford basic needs. Yeah good luck with this one.",hqbfqtq,t1_hqb5ssd,/r/news/comments/rqjlcp/us_home_prices_surge_184_in_october/hqbfqtq/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,0,,,

WintersEnvoy,"Bubble: having cash is stupid, most worldwide governments make it clear permanent low interest rates are a new norm  


If you can get a loan with 1.5 % interest or less, not taking it and investing it into random shit like stocks, housing, or NFTs (crypto bros would argue) then youre losing money. Now crank up the scales to most of society.   


This hasnt been true in history before and [interest rates havent been under 2 % when the economy is booming for as long as it has now](https://www.gzeromedia.com/the-graphic-truth-50-years-of-us-inflation-vs-interest-rates). The implication is that, anyone who can take a loan and buy a home should because not doing it is costing you money, which is just compounding itself as a problem since its going up so rapidly. Historically after the depression and following a scandinavian economic model, rates were only kept low to stimulate the economy in times of recession (so it could later be paid off, e.g national debt during economic upturns)  


But the last few decades countries took this to the max, because they figure why not have have low interest rates during good times too, since that also stimulates the economy (which it does), so now during economic downturns how do you actually stimulate the economy if you cant bring interest rates from 0 to 0 %? Well some countries had a negative interest rate for a while. And now during covid governments just directly gave out loans to companies rather than indirectly via central banks. Further proving that governments are willing to do anything to stop a major economic downturn because the thought is that a recession is worse than the increasing wealth gap and increasing inflation (generally not any evil intent).",hqbc3qp,t1_hqb0buc,/r/news/comments/rqjlcp/us_home_prices_surge_184_in_october/hqbc3qp/,1,news,t5_2qh3l,r/news,0,,,

This is definitely true. Gold is a good analog because it really has no use value (compared to its speculation value). Crypto-detractors will say gold is useful in electronics or something, but not more than aluminum, silicon, or copper. None of while have a similar valuation. Gold is purely speculation.

It lets you bake the terms of sale into the item. It's not always as simple as ""pay X get 100% ownership of Y."" 

You can also do stuff like license specific art to specific websites (so the blockchain would say this art can ONLY be used on a certain site... this would make it easy for something like Google images to attribute images to the copyright owner.

1) The assets are not secured on the blockchain.

2) The NFT is just a digital receipt with a paper trail for a digital asset with literally no inherent value.

3) Said receipt doesn't even provide you with a means to recreate, view, or verify the thing you bought; it's a URL or a serial number or maybe a hash. It's useless for what you just described (confirming data on location).

&gt; Its the technology that's groundbreaking not whatever trend you care so deeply about.

It's not even remotely groundbreaking. The original idea of the blockchain was pretty groundbreaking. This is literally completely unremarkable other than the insane amount of people so stupid as to believe it *is* groundbreaking.

&gt; are you saying NFTs will be any different on that aspect?

Yes. 

The reason those other methods have any value at all is that they are recognized from a legal perspective. NFTs will never replace that. They're a dumb fad.

&gt; Who is beeple? And why are you giving me an artists view on a subject about non fungible tokens. This is computer science ffs.

Avar1cious,"&gt; ""It's imaginary money"" - All money is imaginary

Didn't argue this.

&gt;""It has no intrinsic value"" - Depends entirely on the blockchain. Stuff like Bitcoin is purely storage of value. Things like Ethereum and Cardano offer smart contracts and NFTs (which, by the way, are not limited to stupid images of monkeys). Others like Ripple and Stellar offer lighting fast transactions and are already being used by major banks such as Santander.

If you look at my other replies, I separate out the blockchain from any individual crypto in my critique. I think the blockchain technology is cool and you can definitely argue for its value - but the blockchain is not unique to any one crypto. Bitcoin isn't worth its current amount because it uses blockchain technology - otherwise what about all the other cryptos? It's worth its current amount because of network effects.

Regardless, whether or not major institutions adopt it doesn't bear any consequence for the argument. I'm sure tons of institutions would love to be middlemen in a bunch of these coins and cash in.

&gt;""It's too volatile"" - Most of the time it's stable with a few days where it goes down 20%-25%, and then it goes back up and beyond. If you've kept track of the stock market any time lately, crypto movements are almost synchronized with tech stocks.

And this is completely unacceptable as a currency....which really, other than to fund offshore casinos or other niche things, it really isn't used as such. It's treated as a speculative asset at this point (which defeats its original intent of replacing a centralized currency but whatever). No currency from a government body completely not in the shitter has a currency that moves it like does...it would be unusable. And that's before you consider that any crypto with a finite supply will inherently cause deflation in the economy if ever used as a main state currency.

And, most importantly, why on earth are you comparing a movement of a ""currency"" to the movement of a high PE stock? That's lunacy - they have completely different standards.....can you imagine if the FX rate was as volatile as Tesla? Moreover, isn't it concerning that your ""decentralized solution"" that's supposed to take over as the ""main-stay"" currency after the institutions fail us are highly correlated (or synchronized in your own words) with the markets? Shouldn't it be increasing in value if it's being traded on the belief that it'll be the currency of the future, rather than crashing with the markets like it was driven up by a combination of insiders + dumb money?

&gt;""When you buy stocks you own part of the company"" - When you buy a token you own a part of the blockchain, depending on the utility of the blockchain it's just as valid of an investment as buying stocks of a tech company.

Could you elaborate on this? So for instance, if I hold stock of Company A, I'm entitled to a portion of all future net equity/distributions from Company A. Is owning a blockchain equivalent to that? What do I get for my ownership of it?

&gt;""Stocks pay dividends"" - And Proof of Stake tokens pay staking rewards.

Yes.....rewards in crypto no? Once again, this begs the question that crypto is valuable - otherwise the rewards worth have no worth.

&gt;Do you really think Hedge funds or major companies like Tesla would buy bitcoin if it were a scam?

I never said it was a scam, it's a speculative asset that will inevitably burst and screw over a bunch of FOMO investors who don't know what they're doing. And yes, I fully expect large institutions to jump in - if there's money to be made in the interim, why not? This appeal to authority fails in that not only have these bodies failed to detect iffy shit before (ie: Bernie Madoff), but their participation doesn't preclude the fact there's fundamental value involved (Hence why no pension fund or long-term institutional investor like Warren Buffet touches this stuff).

Anyway, I don't think it's very good faith of you to assume that I haven't read anything on blockchain/crypto (not an expert, but I consulted a friend who's a trader + watched some online videos) as well as try to either strawman (imaginary money) or poison the well (making it sound like criticizing a ""currency's"" volatility is crazy) on a lot of these critiques.",hn93uau,t1_hn8rdle,/r/news/comments/r8mwt2/crypto_crash_570_billion_wiped_off_market_cap/hn93uau/,5,news,t5_2qh3l,,0,,,

""My uncle bought $SQUID and lost all his life savings, it's a scam"" - Look I'm not disagreeing that some tokens are complete scams, and there are definitely lots of scams out there, but if you get scammed with dollars you don't say the dollar is a ponzi scheme, do you? Also, these scams usually require a fair bit of work around as they're not listed in major exchanges, so if people go out of their way to lose their money to a scam, that's their problem.

&gt; If you pay 1 eth for one of their axies. You only have an axie you need to sell to someone else. They don't owe you anything. Thats why traditional ponzi games are dying out and everyone is moving to crypto. Hell, even pretty much every traditional ponzi game is saying they earn their revenue from crypto. (They don't earn shit, thats a lie. To create the fictional source of the funds that they supposedly use to pay you. In case you don't know enough about ponzis)

Who's ""they"" the company or the players? 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To create the fictional source of the funds that they supposedly use to pay you

Who's paying who? for what?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Exactly as you said. They still sell because the supposed earning potential is supposedly high and enough people still trust it to keep operating long enough for them to earn their money back. (This also generates a big army of supporters that will tell you the game is awesome, because they want it to keep going until they earned their money back, even if they lost faith)

Yes, I agree. How does this fit into a ponzi scheme? You're saying the game dies if people dont find value in it and dont want to participate anymore right? 

Okay the same thing goes for literally anything in the world. If people dont find movies enjoyable and dont want to pay to see it, act in it, pay to produce it then it'll collapse.   


&gt;Scholars aren't in the ponzi system. As long as they don't have to pay to become a scholar. They are required to keep the pretens of a game alive, as otherwise those who are investing and hording all the nfts couldn't use them all to ""earn"".

yes exactly, they're in their own economy. The reason they participate doenst matter. It does not matter that they want to earn money or if they want to play the game. The important thing is they're participating in the economy. 

They're burning tokens, they're selling and trading axies, they're breeding because everyone in the economy believes it has value. 

The same thing goes on in the real world. If everyone right now decides money doesnt equate to shit. Then everything goes to hell.

 What is your point? if your point is that the game will die, then yeah probably. if your point is that it's a ponzi. I dont agree. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Trust.... you trust it to be real... if not you cash out. But if the general consensus is that its not real, no one will buy your stuff. So all the supposed billions of value all the investors are holding in nfts and axies becomes zero

Yes.. like anything with value in the real world. If enough people trust in it to have value. It does. You don't have to be salty about the fact that people sell and trade useless digital assets online lmao. 

but dont claim that old investors are screwing newer investors. when its very clearly just a simulated economy. Yes, of course it'll crash if no one finds value in it anymore.

Because that is also not about Axie but about traditional ponzies? 

&gt; Are you saying the game purposely made it hard for people to cash out so people store more wealth in game?

Yes. For the first layer. If you had to hold 1 eth in a game wallet in order to play, thats just a withdrawl from their wallet. If you pay 1 eth for one of their axies. You only have an axie you need to sell to someone else. They don't owe you anything. Thats why traditional ponzi games are dying out and everyone is moving to crypto.

&gt; Define ""hard"" because it's not hard at all to liquidate your assets in this game except for breeders/managers who actually hold the axies becuase they do need to sell them. Even then, axies sell out fast.

So far, not very different from many gacha games, except that players who grind the game get a cut of the revenue.

However, by making it possible to sell your in game stuff, buying items can be framed as an ""investment"". Where in a gacha game, the money just goes straight down the drain, Axie players can sell off all their NFTs on the market and get money back. But since the total amount of NFTs in the system is constantly increased by players grinding the game, the nominal value of all players' wallets grows at a greater rate than the actual money flowing in.

Can I get a TV that is just a TV, please?

I have other devices that I can interchange (consoles, chrome cast, etc.), does everything the smart side of a Smart TV does, and easily stay up to date. I just need a display that will function, and not potentially brick itself little by little, all because a couple apps are no longer updated, or hasn't been able to check for an update for X period. Thanks!

I've got a couple smart TVs, granted no Samsung, both of which lasted maybe three years before apps like Netflix or Hulu stopped working, all because the apps can't update anymore.

A client of my IT Shop bought a Smart TV, older lady who was retired, and couldn't use the TV until it had reached out to the internet for an update. Funny thing, she didn't have internet, had no need. The local Walmart didn't have any non-smart TVs. To my knowledge, this is the only smart TV I've touched that required the internet. Thankfully, after the update through a hotspot (my cell), was able to disable the update function (otherwise nagged every half hour due to no internet), and she was able to watch satellite and DVDs normally. I can only suspect a factory reset, accidental or otherwise, will require internet again during setup.

I'm not necessarily that old, early 30s, I can see *some* use cases for NFTs, but most I see talked about, are just flashy and stupid. Maybe NFTs for owning digital movies might be a thing, making it easy like physical to give/sell your owned copy to someone else, unlike other services like Amazon where you buy a movie, or Steam where you buy a game, and it's on your account, with no way to give it to someone else.

They also mentioned NFTs, digital market places, and so on. There is a plan and it is set to deploy. 

Not to forget RC also wants apes to research the companies and people tied to these nefarious acts and the web of crime associated with them. It is far reaching and throughout our financial and business industries as well as charities and everywhere. People do a lot of bad crime under the guise of dark pools and donating to charities and running them. If you ever need a rabbit hole to go down, check out the saga of GME.

Real world scenario that came up when nfts hit, people would craft fake nfts that would automatically transfer everything in a person's wallet to a different account if you interacted well th it at all.  It would just show up in your account one day.  If you even just clicked on it to find out what it was the payload would go off and it will upd steal all your stuff.

And to the eth ledger this is 100% legit and eth will do nothing to prevent that.  Not even a ""are you sure"" dialogue box popping up.

It's literally click gone done.  

You are talking potentially immense sums of money.  Some people have more crypto than a small country has a budget and yet zero safeguards are in place incase the user is compromised.

And hackers and cyber criminals almost never attempt man in the middle, which crypto is incredibly strong against.  It's always an attack on where the data is first entered.  Thanks to the ability for me to just drop things into your wallet, things that can make transactions on your behalf without your approval the ledger is susceptible to false info.  Because it trusts itself and it's users far too much.

Some have tried to solve this problem but they either aren't important enough cause they aren't worth anything.  Or are too slow to really be used.

Aetheus,"&gt;It's garbage because we have something similar?

No, it's garbage because it does not meaningfully (and usefully) distinguish itself from the ""something similar"" that we already have. The Internet, smartphones, etc - they might not have had universal adoption from day 1, but their proponents were clearly touting their value proposition from day 1. 

Nobody (not even the likes of the companies developing their own ""metaverses"") even seems to have an idea of what the ""metaverse"" *is,* or what you're supposed to do in it. All descriptions of it thus far have been vague video-game / VRChat pitches, occasionally mixed with a bit of snake oil (NFTs). Even the promises that you can ""take one thing you bought here and bring it to somewhere else in the Metaverse"" so common in many pitches makes no sense - each ""metaverse"" that an individual company makes is its own walled garden, and they'd have to build in support for external assets from external ""metaverses"".

The utility is simply not well explained - you can't handwave stuff away by saying ""Oh, nobody believed in *the Internet* at first either!"", even Bill in that video gave a good pitch of what the Internet would be *for*.

shadowrun456,"&gt;I remain unconvinced. The examples you listed are all what I would call fringe, if not completely fictional.

My examples are, by definition, fictional, because they don't exist yet. Fringe? Sure, but this was said about every new technology. People about mobile phones in 1999: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bdWZocq4vQ (click subtitles for English). You may not remember, but that was the mainstream opinion and ""common sense"" at the time. Just like with NFTs now.

I don't really have a goal to ""convince"" you as such. I am just expressing my opinion, based on my personal, academic, and professional experience (Bachelor's degree in programming, Master's degree in crypto, part-time working as a lecturer).

&gt;The number of people who want to transfer their ingame items to another game after the original already failed is minuscule

&gt;Same thing with digital media, the amount of people who genuinely only want to resell their old collections is negligible.

I agree, but see my first paragraph and video about people's opinion about mobile phones in 1999.

&gt;as is the number of people seriously affected by duping.

I strongly disagree here, I think item duping is one of the major unsolved (until now) problems in online gaming. Rockstar made over 1 billion $ just from selling in-game GTA cash in GTA Online for real $. And this is despite the fact, that almost every time I got online there was some hacker dropping unlimited amounts of GTA cash for anyone who wanted just for lulz. Now imagine it was impossible to duplicate GTA cash. Of course, most of those hackers won't start buying it for real $, but if making GTA cash unduplicatable increases Rockstar's sales of it even by 10%, that's already additional 100 million $ for Rockstar.

&gt;We also already had ingame auction houses and the like which achieved most, if not all, of what you stated without the need for NFTs.

The main difference is that previously this was achieved using a centralized database run and controlled by the company who created it. No company is ever going to use a db created and controlled by another company for their own game, as it would make their success completely dependent on the whims of the company which controls the db. NFTs solve that by introducing a decentralized, public, neutral tech standard, which anyone can use, but no single company can control.",i16nenp,t1_i107ocx,/r/technology/comments/teepat/i_need_to_use_my_cds_again_social_media/i16nenp/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,0,,,

shadowrun456,"You're looking at the first generation of NFTs and fail to see the benefits this technology will bring when it's fully developed and widely used. This is normal, it was very difficult to understand the benefits of email when sending an email included using your landline phone to dial into your modem, flipping some mechanical switches, and then using DOS commands to send the actual email. Also, almost no one used email or even knew what it was, so there was no one you could really write an email to.

Here's an instructional video from 1984 showing ""how easy it is to send an email"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szdbKz5CyhA

Most people after watching it at that time went ""yep, this is dumb, no one will ever use this"".

Now, when you can send email with one click on your smartphone to probably any person you know, the benefits are obvious. They weren't in 1984.

It's demonstrably useful being able to create items in a video game which are impossible to duplicate (every single online game I know of until now had duplication glitches), don't disappear even if the company who made the game goes bankrupt and shuts down the servers, and can be easily implemented into any other game.

It's demonstrably useful being able to easily transfer your purchased song/movie/game/book/etc to anyone else, even to people who use different services than you.

And that's just two potential use cases. Yes, this doesn't exist yet, but the technology which enables this exists, and it didn't before.

It takes time and lots of steps to reach a situation where a critical mass of companies join this, and until only a few companies do, I agree that the benefits will be minuscule compared to what they will be when everyone joins.

The NFTs themselves, what they are, how they're made/sold/destroyed aren't in a grey area so those answers are concrete.

""Ownership"" is often touted as a selling point of NFTs and crypto but all you own is the ""token"".  Without scarcity nothing can be owned, and digital goods cannot be scarce.  You pay hundreds of dollars to assign a hash and a URL to your crypto wallet.

If they're going to run a streaming service based on NFTs all they're doing is checking to see if your wallet is assigned a specific NFT and only letting you stream the song if you have it.  Realistically in that use case it's not significantly different than a traditional license file or just assigning a license to your account.  Except if they'd used a public blockchain like Ethereum then it costs hundreds of dollars to create, transaction fees to sell to other people, and are _WAY_ more wasteful of computing resources and electricity than traditional licensing which is often a contributing factor to the tendency of pitchfork-wielding mobs to follow NFT announcements around.",i0sug1o,t1_i0sjfph,/r/technology/comments/teepat/i_need_to_use_my_cds_again_social_media/i0sug1o/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,0,,,

Sloloem,"No one should _ever_ want an NFT to replace the title or deed to things they actually own.  I want crypto as far away from anything I rely on for comfort or livelihood as possible.  Proponents like to tout aspects of the decentralized nature of public blockchains and the ""If you can do it, you can do it"" approach as good things but for your actual property that's the last thing you actually want.  And this is why:  Blockchains are immutable.  It's their fundamental design feature.  It's what the technology _does_.  Meaning any transaction on a blockchain is permanent.  Even fraudulent ones.  Even coerced ones.  Even ones with errors.

This ""wild west"" attitude is an asset if you're looking to run an unregulated speculative market, not so much if you want to be able to protect your property.  If someone breaks into your wallet they can take all your NFTs, immediately and irrevocably.  The folks hyping crypto will say you should have protected your wallet better because if you have the wallet you can do anything you want with it.  As far as the blockchain is concerned, accessing the wallet is enough to prove you own everything in it.  When these NFTs point at stupid fucking clipart, we get make fun of that loss.  But if the NFT is what says you own your car or your own house you're fucked.  The _best case_ scenario is that the person that stole my NFT can sell it back to me if I cover gas fees.  But since according to the blockchain everything that's happened is fair and square, I have no other recourse than to hope they don't feel like extorting me and are willing to deal.

If someone breaks into my house and steals the title to my car they can't register the title change without me signing off.  Sure they can forge my signature or something but as soon as I'm able to appeal to a higher power at the DMV and prove it was faked, the DMV can just fix the data.  I'm not gonna say the DMV can't be rigged or always works right and never screws people who are in the right but at least there's an option.  There's someone to appeal to and if everything is working right the system can fix fraud or errors.  With NFTs there's no such thing because they're decentralized and that's considered a selling point.  There's no authority to deny any valid transaction or to seize your assets held on the chain like there is with traditional banking, but the opposite side of the same coin is that there's no authority to oversee the legitimacy of anything so if you accidentally fat-fingered the transaction and sold your car for $5...sucks to be you.",i0sqcmp,t1_i0pnkmw,/r/technology/comments/teepat/i_need_to_use_my_cds_again_social_media/i0sqcmp/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,0,,,

Sloloem,"You're gonna love this:


&gt; Is it registered on the Patent and Copyright Office and then transferred to you?

No.  The purchase of an NFT generally confers no legal ownership or rights to the product attached to the NFT.  Death Row Records retains ownership and copy right.

&gt; Can you use a different service instead of Death Row records to hold the NFT?

No.  NFTs need to stay on the blockchain they were originally minted on.  So if Death Row starts their own blockchain in order to save money on minting tokens they need to stay on Death Row's blockchain.  If they use Ethereum, the tokens are bound to the Ethereum chain.

&gt; Can you register it as yours in the USPTO?

No.  A piece of work attached to an NFT is not a part of the NFT and the NFT is not part of the work.  The NFT is a cryptographic hash linking to a document that describes and points at the work.  As such, all you ""own"" is the hash which serves no purpose on its own and can't be trademarked.

&gt; Can they limit your usage of the service, or are they bound only by good faith?

Provisionally yes but I'm not entirely sure what service and who ""they"" are in this question.  If you're referring to Death Row, then yes Death Row can disable their marketplace or otherwise control who is allowed to submit transactions to their block chain.  In traditional NFTs, the tokens are on a blockchain that's otherwise dedicated to a specific cryptocurrency while the NFTs are traded using NFT marketplace sites.  A while back there was a high profile ""theft"" of NFTs because with cryptocurrencies all you need is the wallet's private key and you can do whatever you want to anything inside that wallet.  The marketplace blocked the contested NFTs from being traded with their site but the underlying blockchain continued to allow their trading because the blockchain has no central authority.

If they build a system where proving ownership of an NFT is required to stream the song then yes, but if you download the file locally unencumbered by any other DRM schemes then no...it's just an MP3 or whatever.  NFT is just a hash somewhere else and can't control anything unless you're using software specifically designed around the NFT instead of a traditional license.

&gt; Can you delete/destroy your copy of the song?

Yes, of course.  Again, somewhat provisional.  If you just download a file, nothing about NFTs stops you from deleting that file...or creating 7000 copies of that file and emailing it to all your friends.  If Death Row sets up their own streaming service that checks for the presence of an NFT before allowing you to stream a song...maybe.  If they use a public blockchain like Ethereum for their NFTs, you can destroy the token by a transaction that either ""burns"" the token or assigns it to a black-hole wallet which permanently renders it inaccessible.  But if they use a private blockchain then you can only destroy your token if they let you.

&gt; Can they produce more of them without your consent?

Oh hell yes.  Frankly there's nothing stopping you from producing your own NFTs of Snoop's songs without his permission either.  NFTs are hashes that only point to other works.  There's nothing scarce about the digital works themselves but the tokens themselves are technically unique enough to be identifiable but the whole scheme may as well be writing down ""17"" in someone's guest book, giving them $200 for the privilege and claiming that ""17"" gives you some form of ownership over a JPG or MP3.",i0s8fbk,t1_i0px5tf,/r/technology/comments/teepat/i_need_to_use_my_cds_again_social_media/i0s8fbk/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,0,,,

One way is to sell the rights of a song through an NFT drop and collect revenue from secondary sales of the NFTs. It has proven to be a very profitable model in the speculative visual art space. 

Lots of potential utility in that format of nft too, like perks, airdrops, special merch and front of the line passes for future shows. It could be great for fans and artists, and with enough adoption *should* work. I think it's exciting but do worry about the financialization of things we've never financialized before.

FalseFortune,"The individual NFTs are unique but the asset tied to them does not have to be. 

Creating a NFT is referred to as minting or tokenizing, you can mint as many ""copies"" of the ""asset"" as you want. Many artist will mint thousands of NFTs of the same piece of art. But typically the less total minted of an item the more valuable the NFT would be. Also the first minted typically holds more value that the preceding mints. The NTF itself is more like a certificate of authenticity or a title of ownership. 

Ford sells thousands of red F150s each one can be identical in appearance to the other but the vin number and the title make each one unique, that in a sense is what a NFT is. Actually if Ford chose to, and could get state DMVs to adopt it, they could replace there vehicle titles with NFTs. This is where the average person could find real value in NFTs. They can be used for tamper proof, non forge-able, non replicable titles of ownership for any real property, land, house, car, ect...

Sorry for the long post but I feel all the crazy hype over the over priced art NFTs is overshadowing the real value of NFT technology. If more people knew what is capable with NFTs, other than the current art scams, then I think they would be more welcoming to the technology.",i0pnkmw,t1_i0pg6c7,/r/technology/comments/teepat/i_need_to_use_my_cds_again_social_media/i0pnkmw/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,0,,,

NFTs are designed to raise money for public goods. Vanced created a public good that a LOT of people clearly found very valuable. The problem is that this public good was stealing money from a greedy corporation. That's illegal.

So it needs funding, but it can't charge money directly. It needs to stay free. The solution is almost certainly going to involve crypto. NFTs are a perfect form of retroactive public goods funding.

It was a solution where everyone wins, especially users who don't want to pay for stuff - especially stuff that shouldn't be paywalled in the first place, like background play.

Maybe companies decide it's not lucrative enough to try to incentivize customers to put on a headset to order wings.

The internet brought functionality which drastically altered the ways, as well as introduced new ways, in which businesses and people could perform tasks substantially better. Metaverse does not. Infact, the propositions are mostly in ways which will make the tasks worse and slower, promising only to make it ""cool"". Actually a ""fad"". Only a few small narrow niche markets would benefit from metaversing and marginally so. Without understanding the mechanical features that make an endeavor worthy of converting to this paradigm, people are rushing to find ways to shoehorn an excuse to do so. In other words, a ""fad"". 

To be fair,  The internet also had a period it went through similar to this in its early days. The difference is that the internet has features that previously did not exist, and only when such features could be exploited did it emerge from a being just a fad. Ubiquitous connectivity, speed, scalability, convenience, platform flexibility. We already have these with internet. Meta does not add anything new.

In other words, you have to aggressively claim false use. The problem is that because it's solely a digital good, you're flat out of luck. I can reproduce, share and send out reproductions of your work way quicker than anyone can whack-a-mole me down with copyright claims. And therefore, it will have expanded into the public domain, and no longer warrant copyright protection.

There's a public ledger **of who minted it**. Not who made it. Understand the difference? I can start minting stuff that I didn't make, and there's no verification process to verify that the person doing the minting is the creator. This has been a massive problem. Many artists have gotten completely screwed over by NFTs, because other people who did not do the art minted the NFTs, and now they don't get shit.

&gt; NFT Music Stream bills itself as a decentralized music distribution system designed to empower artists through the wonders of NFTs. After artists in their droves complained that their songs were being distributed against their wishes, the platform admitted that the tracks were being pulled from YouTube. Even worse, one of those musicians is artists' champion David Lowery, a fighter they really don't want to take on.

&gt; The non-fungible token (NFT) craze that‚Äôs been sweeping the internet for months now is a truly sight to behold. Huge sums of cryptocurrency are traded for these often Ethereum blockchain ‚Äòitems‚Äô alongside dreams that one day they will be worth substantially more.

&gt; As a result, the hype around NFTs (particularly where they relate to some kind of art) has reached astonishing levels, with new projects appearing all the time promising to revolutionize this and democratize that. Since the music industry is often criticized for not doing enough to support artists, some platforms have decided they can do better.

&gt; Thus far, it hasn‚Äôt gone well. Early February the RIAA stepped in to issue a cease-and-desist against HitPiece.com, describing it as a scam site designed to mislead and defraud fans with its offer to sell them NFTs genuinely associated with artists. According to their RIAA, that certainly wasn‚Äôt the case

&gt; With HitPiece now in some kind of hibernation, another NFT-focused platform has been thrust into the spotlight afting launching this month. NFT Music Stream promises a ‚Äúnew chain of sound‚Äù alongside pledges to bring artists, fans, distributors and labels together ‚Äúin one single beautiful, efficient and transparent‚Äù NFT music platform.

&gt; ‚ÄúNFT MUSIC STREAM is a fun, exciting private NFT Music platform where content creators can charge for audio &amp; music content and get paid in crypto. It gives investors the freedom to distribute, monetize, and stream audio via our NFT MUSIC Streaming Platform,‚Äù the service says.

&gt; ‚ÄúWe have established a decentralized music distribution and royalty management system to better reward artists and their fans. NFT Music Stream connects fans directly with artists in a beautiful music player interface.‚Äù

&gt; That music player was available on Streamer.fm but despite its claims to help ‚Äúcut out the middle man‚Äù to give artists a greater share of the spoils, many quickly realized that something was amiss. According to the masses of complaints from artists on Twitter, few ‚Äì if any ‚Äì had agreed to have their music placed on the platform.

&gt; Composer Kerry Muzzey, for example, took to Twitter to complain that the new streaming service had no rights to monetize his copyrighted works. However, after an unspecified number of DMs to the @nftmusicstream account, they blocked him along with many other artists making similar complaints.",hxai6ho,t3_sulh16,/r/technology/comments/sulh16/disaster_as_nft_music_stream_enrages_artists_by/hxai6ho/,0,technology,t5_2qh16,,0,,,

__Hello_my_name_is__,"&gt;  your transactions can only be reversed if you can somehow convince the majority of the network to do that. If only your NFT gets stolen, it's unlikely that the whole network would agree to reverse that transaction just for you. 

So, in practice: No, this is not at all possible. And so, in practice, the blockchain is absolutely immutable in this specific case. In *theory*, sure, if you can get everyone to agree, it is mutable. But in practice, it absolutely is not.

That was my point.

&gt; This has actually happened and it's why we have Ethereum and Ethereum Classic. Ethereum Classic is the remainder of the nodes who did not agree to revert.

Maybe Wikipedia is wrong on this one, but over there it's stated pretty clearly that Ethereum Classic is the original blockchain, and Ethereum as we know it today is the fork. All other sources I find say the same. That seems to contradict what you said.

&gt; I think you should look into it more in terms of ""which chain has the most supporters"" and not ""which chain is closest to the original"".

Sure, that's fair. But terms like ""fork"" are clearly defined. It is very clear which version is the fork and which version isn't. ETH is the fork, ETH classic is not.

My question was: Can transactions be undone *without* a fork. That is, for the blockchain that is not the fork. The answer seems to be: No. The only way is to fork (or get literally everyone to agree otherwise, which in practice never, ever happens). And sure, the majority might join the fork (as was the case with ETH), but it remains, technically speaking, a fork.

I mean you can't just throw the whitepaper at me and get properly technical, only to now get all wishy washy on what is and isn't a fork.

My ultimate point here is that crypto-fans love to claim how immutable the blockchain is (and how that's a good thing), when in reality (as you say) it's not nearly as simple. But also, that said non-immutability only works via forking when it comes to the actual, real life use cases (ETH vs. ETH classic, etc.), while individual ""rewinding"" (""Someone stole my NFT!"") is just not happening, ever. And that the original blockchain always remains in some way, too. Which gets kinda sorta really relevant as soon we we talk about NFTs that include personal data. Which just shows that this entire damn tech is just really kind of pointless for all the intended use cases that I've ever seen.",hx11oju,t1_hx0y6wk,/r/technology/comments/sslcxv/hacker_couldve_printed_unlimited_ether_but_chose/hx11oju/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,,0,,,

&gt; In a democracy you wouldn't want your laws to be set in stone, even if they seem like a good idea at first. You want to be able to change them if the majority agrees.

Well, yeah. But I don't quite want the amount of money in my bank account to be defined by the whim of the majority, nor do I want the deed of my house to be dependent on that.

I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just wondering what the point of all this is.

arachnivore,"&gt;I get the feeling you don't understand these systems as well as you think you do.

I understand it well enough to know it's bullshit. It's kind-of interesting tech, but it ultimately fails to accomplish what its sold as and some of what is sold is (like putting medical history on the block-chain) is truly horrifying. 

I understand cryptographic hashing.  
I understand public and private keys.  
I understand how ~~linked lists~~ block chains work.  
I understand that the first line of defense for crypto hacks is, ""you don't understand"".  
I understand that when you design a currency to double as an investment vehicle, you've designed a shitty currency. Add to that the extreme encumbrance of the ""trustless"" system and almost nobody uses your currency as a currency. It's just a fundamentally empty speculative circle-jerk that goes up and down based on the ferocity of the jerking so it incentivizes everyone involved to adopt a cult-like mentality of spreading the great circle-jerk.  
I understand that there's more to security than cryptography.  
I understand that the concept of a ""trustless"" system is undermined in about every way possible:  
You're trusting a system of extreme complexity, built by humans, to operate without flaws.  
You're trusting unregulated exchanges.  
You're trusting bug hunters to claim prizes instead of exploit the system.  
You're trusting that such exploitations are easily detectable even if you're not looking for them.  
You're trusting mining pools which are incentivized to grow ever larger to govern their own behavior as they reach close to 50% of the network share.  
I know that most of the approaches to make the system less cumbersome also weaken the system's already weak guarantees.  
I know that cryptographic hashes have pretty much never been proven secure. Nearly every cryptographic hash that came before SHA-256 succumbed to exploits and there are known new exploits keep being discovered that chip away at the assumptions that proof-of-work relies on. Someone may have already found a killer exploit and told nobody because it means they can mine coins at a much higher rate than anyone else.  
There's a lot I don't understand because it's a big complex system. I don't understand all the obfuscated financial instruments involved in the 2008 recession. It was still clearly a bubble inflated by rampant greed. It's clear to me that the problems crypto currency purports to solve are either not what causes most financial woes (e.g. inflation) or aren't actually solved by the system (fraud, speculation bubbles, wealth consolidation, exploitation, etc.)

I know that fraud is rampant in the crypto space. From [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g) investigating NFTs:

&gt;I also learned a lot about fraud, and how to do it both on purpose and by accident. The term, ""rug pull"" with its derivations ""rug"" and ""rugged"", all to describe projects that made big promises but then took the money and ran, embedded themselves in my vocabulary extremely quickly.  
The market is just absolutely lousy with fraud and deception:  
""Wash trading""; where you sell something to your own ""sockpuppets"" in order to lure in real buyers who think they're getting a good deal, is rampant.  
Market manipulation is so common and accepted that it's actually considered bad form if project leaders don't actively engage in it. like, it's considered disrespectful to the buyers if the project leaders don't help them inflate the resale price.

I know that, as a machine learning researcher, all those GPUs could go to much much much better use than calculating hashes with a specific number of leading zeros. It's painful to see them used by a bunch of circle-jerking libertarians huffing their own farts and shouting ""decentralization"" like they have any clue what that means.

&gt;Yes..I know what rollups are. The bridge contract is still on l1, not off-chain, called the Optimism Gateway.

OK. I'll bite. Optimism is supposed to somehow reduce transaction fees. So you create a contract with them. Does that contract go on L1? If so, isn't it subject to transaction fees?

Optimism keeps their own ""off chain"" record of the currency you gave them called L2. The bug happens when you cancel your contract and a balance remains on L2. Supposedly, you do this quickly. Does that mean you can cancel the contract before the creation of the contract is verified and added to L1? Is there a way to revoke the creation of the contract such that it never shows up on L1?

I'll assume there isn't because you claim you could use the contract creation to identify this scam. Wouldn't that mean that a contract cancelation event now has to be added to L1? How do the creation and cancellation events get verified without anyone paying a fee? Doesn't it take work to add blocks of transactions to the chain?

When you audit the block chain, wouldn't you just see one of the following:  
1) Nothing if the contract creation is revocable upon cancelation.  
2) A bunch of contract creations and re-funds from cancelations.

Would you know or care that some guy tried 30 times in a row to create a contract with optimism only to cancel it 30 times? How would you catch something like that on the block-chain if you didn't know to specifically look for it? 

It really sounds like this is a problem on optimism's side that you wouldn't be able to catch by observing L1 alone.",hx06y1u,t1_hwzracg,/r/technology/comments/sslcxv/hacker_couldve_printed_unlimited_ether_but_chose/hx06y1u/,-1,technology,t5_2qh16,,0,,,

7point7,"I‚Äôm in the middle of lunch break so not too much time to respond to each point. Yea, in many areas I conflate blockchain and crypto but from what I‚Äôve seen the two are linked. Blockchain transactions are associated with token values to process the value of transaction from one owner of an asset to the next. You could do it with USD, and many, like NBA Top Shots, does just that. However the consumer Choice of using crypto would be what I‚Äôd argue is the biggest change to society so far. People aren‚Äôt tied to just one currency and it‚Äôs like real-time forex trading in a digital world. Different physical markets have different currencies and now different digital markets are receiving them as well. 


On that point - I think you calling NFTs ‚Äúthe cream of the crop of bullshit is misinformed.

-timenotspace-,"""the idea behind bitcoin"" was decentralization and immutability

&amp;#x200B;

these principles now apply to the internet itself. decentralized applications can be written. the processing and evaluation of their functions is decentralized and verified and immutable. this is what ethereum is / does

&amp;#x200B;

don't use volatile cryptos if you're looking for a store of value. use volatile if you're making plays and seeking to be a 'trader,' use stablecoins if you're looking to store value. and speaking of value, any single human can now use decentralized finance protocols and applications to do with their money what banks do with their money. except instead of letting the banks do it behind the scenes and keep all the profit, the individuals are directly rewarded proportional to their investment. this is the real benefit of 'being your own bank' because banks just profit off of their members.

&amp;#x200B;

many cryptos are volatile, but stablecoins like USDC are pegged to the USD and can be used to buy groceries (or you can convert whatever amount of whatever you. need into USDC at the time of purchase)

&amp;#x200B;

you also say there shouldn't be 1000 different digital currencies, but i ask you how many companies there are? how many websites? how many different applications? there are definitely uses for application-specific tokens, each has a different use case they're not all just value speculations. NFTs have utility now, and certain features of a d-App or product can't be used or accessed unless you validate yourself as the holder (which is verified, immutable, and trustless)

&amp;#x200B;

it's also open, any project can build off of any other. this is open source reaching its peak. this is the next step of the internet's evolution. web2 (client-server model) -&gt; web3 (decentralized applications)

&amp;#x200B;

The idea behind bitcoin didn't get corrupted, it evolved and expanded into other relevant areas as the technology developed and new innovative thinkers got their hands on it and began to wrap their minds around its capabilities

&amp;#x200B;

and the government wants money, yes, but they also don't want to stifle innovation. and this is why developers, stakers, and validators are not being considered 'brokers' under the latest cryptocurrency provisions of the big act they passed

SpiritOfKiki,"I think this is the difference of how we think. You want an answer now and due to the nascent nature of the tech I can‚Äôt give you one. Directionally I can tell you where things are headed and when the support technology (AR, VR, Networking, Smaller footprint for cpu/gpu, etc) occurs mass adoption will follow.

It is not one single thing that is going to result in mass adoption but a series of things across industries. For example, the headsets for VR today are too unwieldy and price a lot of folks out of the market. The visual fidelity isn‚Äôt quite there yet either. We are working through networking to accommodate the bandwidth demands for the Metaverse to function to its full potential. Let alone educating consumers on how to setup, operate and navigate a decentralized identity and the associated assets. 

The article is valuable in describe what I have briefly mentioned above to give you a better understanding where things are headed. Read it or not, it is up to you but it more than supports my point if you dedicate the time to study it.

VR != Metaverse; VR helps with regards to immersion but is not the only aspect to focus on. There is the ownership of assets, the development of economic models that can support/replace wages in some third world countries and identity that is rarely found in our modern platforms. You gotta think that all your data is not owned by you on the web in its current iteration. Metaverse + decentralization will shift the current models toward user-owned assets. 

When talking about games there is a distinction to be made between gaming on a platform owned by a company and Gamefi. Gaming with VR does not add any value to the user in a financial sense. Money flows in only one direction, from the consumer‚Äôs wallet to the company that developed the product. Gamefi changes that dynamic where the user can actually earn an income for playing a game supported by an economic model and sustainable game play system. 

Social media in the metaverse will be completely different then its current iteration on Web 2.0. This will be a shift from platform to user. You know how on Reddit we see a cropped image of a post that was originally posted on Instagram/Facebook/etc. We dislike it when someone else steals credit from the creator or claims ownership when they put no efforts into the creation of this content. Web 3.0 can make the posts NFTs that are unique to the creator and add value to their content creation. Imagine an NFT of a post they made where their followers purchase a fractional interest in the NFT to show their support for their favorite influencer or music artist or digital artist. Ownership is key here and something missing in our current framework. We don‚Äôt profit or own anything now but that changes within the Metaverse where this items can exist in a 2D / 3D form and can add transactional royalty values to the content creator. 

What I am trying to tell you in summary is that the Metaverse &amp; decentralization of digital assets (tokens, files, content, NFTs etc) touches so many aspects of our digital lives it is turning a blind eye to think that it will not change our usage of the web in profound ways.",hwvrjg2,t1_hwvlb57,/r/technology/comments/sqzwi0/22_of_italians_have_stopped_using_social_media_in/hwvrjg2/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,,0,,,

Somehow I don't see MoviePass decentralizing anything it offers (blockchain), nor allowing users to exchange movie credits without moderation (NFTs).

More likely they are going to use an off-the-shelf distributed database (and call it blockchain-like storage) and use it to store user account information like non-transferrable credits (and call them NFTs). The names are just to sucker in dumb VCs who don't actually have any idea what these things are.

In fact, I'm guessing there's going to be a wave of companies calling user credits ""NFTs"". My Audible credits are definitely not ""NFTs"" as people understand them.

If you're Peloton, you're initially selling someone a $1,500 bike. From there, you're charging $40/month ($480/year, if you're lazy) to generate perpetual income. Is that enough annual income when the hardware sales slow? That's what they have to decide. Now, what if it's not?

They can slow hardware manufacturing, cutting production costs. They can do like Netflix (and others) where they raise the subscription cost to increase revenue. Alternatively, they could do something like in gaming, where you get a digital avatar and buy cosmetics that your avatar can wear in a class, if they wanted.

They could also try to sell hardware customization. Make easily replaceable pedals and seats and handlebars. Sell someone that $1,500 base bike, then let them optionally pay $50 for blue pedals or $100 for a green seat. The downside to this strategy is that people love showing off their custom hardware, but biking at home doesn't really allow that (hence my suggestion of a digital avatar).

&gt; The group, which is starting a new marketplace for non-fungible tokens called the Color Museum, has quickly garnered online interest since launching its presale waitlist.

&gt; The concept is what Omar Farooq, the 31-year-old leader of the collective, refers to as &amp;quot;a meta NFT,&amp;quot; meaning that by owning the rights to a specific color, people stand to earn &amp;quot;Royalties&amp;quot; each time a NFT image that uses that color is sold through the marketplace.

&gt; Farooq believes his Color Museum offers hope for a more communal form of capitalism, where financial gains are not hoarded by the few and instead more evenly distributed throughout the web-in this case, to the 10,000 people holding the NFTs. Farooq sees the Color Museum as a competitor to OpenSea, the dominant NFT marketplace.

I would love an EOS x VR experience.

I don't believe execs are as silly as we think. They see a future for gaming like this is possible but it's many years away. Changing how people interact with technology and with one another is a massive undertaking, it happens over a decade blunders and failed projects.

FactAffectionate1397,"I think some of y‚Äôall look at the metaverse in too much of a black/white fashion. IMO the metaverse is going to be much more of a grey concept.

I think the companies that focus on designing a/the metaverse around monetizing people‚Äôs free time rather than function. 

I also think of the metaverse as something broader than a VR experience. IMO If you are on a digital environment spending time socializing, buying things, expressing your identity (personalization) then you are in the metaverse. 

Having said that all that, I think gaming companies have a massive head start on designing digital environments that people enjoy and actually want to be in. Games like GTA, Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, Warzone, Halo, are already addicting af and extremely immersive. There‚Äôs already gaming companies experimenting with play to earn and assigning ownership to digital assets within the game (nfts). 

I think that companies that focus on a metaverse directed towards function and productivity are going to find themselves playing within a very narrow scope and maybe finding out that the metaverse is not well suited to improve a lot of ‚Äúwork‚Äù environments.

Bulletpointe,"What exactly do you mean by called?

Now, I'm no financial expert, but I've wondered about this myself- how does all that debt work?

The answer is bonds. Bonds spaced out over years. Bonds which are supposed to more than pay for themselves in tax revenue and economic activity and GDP generated by the spending and subsequent circulation of money.

It is not physically possible for the US to default on debt short of a political party using congress to commit national suicide. As you've noted, money can be printed.

As you may also have noted, total money supply doesn't have a 1:1 effect on prices, cost of living, etc. In fact, 95% of these moneys generated are winding up in the hands of a vanishingly small population of defacto aristocracy, at the venture capitalist, executive, and shareholder levels.

In previous times, a greater portion of this went to actual working families, but the Raegonomics hard turn away from this into aggressive financialization and capitalization of everything that exists has been primarily responsible for funneling lots and lots of money into the hands of the capital class.  


The current crypto market, somehow, favors the capital class even more. They have a number of distinct advantages, which ironically are only counteracted by literal crimes that introduce risk:  


* If one wants to invest in BTC or ETH, the more you can buy during the dips, the more your money increases, allowing you to buy more during dips. The price, an unknown amount of which is manipulated by wash-trading, becomes prohibitive for anything except extreme marginal fractions to average people.
* Investing in smaller coins is a matter of getting in early, hoping it skyrockets, and getting out before it drops. This is an incredibly risky proposition considering how many are rug pulls and how many don't catch steam. The risk scales to your existing capital- if you have a lot of capital you can afford to invest in a wide variety of these fantasy instruments in hopes to collect if they take off, and if you don't, every investment in smaller coins can be life or death.
* Minting one's own coin requires a sizeable initial investment and technology, which is typically only available to those who have pre-existing capital (because what bank is going to issue a loan for a casino game to Chad Financebro). This is a smart investment if you're collecting on every transaction because even if the coin doesn't take off, you make bank.
* Success for self-minted coins depends entirely on marketing and hype-building, something much more accessible to already-moneyed interests trying to collect.
* All of this applies to NFTs, with extra steps.
* All of this is likely to create a more guaranteed profit if you do it as a rug pull than as an actual long-term investment. The launch of a fantasy instrument is the most turbulent time where most of the money gets made, and after that there's little that's going to move the price other than the project owner with most of the coins wash trading with themselves.
* Because all of these are speculative fantasy instruments that are gambling, the old adage applies: Don't spend more than you can afford to lose. Those who have more can afford to lose more in search of actual long-term profit.

Now, you want to ask me what the actual solution to the crises introduced by all this whackadoodle financial insanity introduced by global economics and market-based gambling?  


Make dollars less necessary to live. All currency and moneys, a medium of exchange, which has become more important than actual human life- that needs to change.

That doesn't change overnight, and our current system cannot make it happen, but this web 3.0 financialization of all life into fantasy assets that are treated like horse races will not help- it will in fact ensure that the average person has LESS DOLLARS. It is designed entirely to funnel massive amounts of wealth into the hands of a few aristocrats, regardless of the entire layout. It's a Greater Fool Scam, where once something stops being perceived as valuable, the hot potato stops getting passed around and the person who bought in last loses EVERYTHING.

There is no scenario in which the U.S. dollar will become worth nothing. There is no scenario where it will stop being accepted as a currency. There are few scenarios where the transaction fees and slow processing times of crypto make sense to accept as a condition of exchange short of criminal activity and gambling, and the output point is always in fiat currency that can actually be spent on shit.

The mistake you made in all of this is assuming the people organizing these block chain projects are more trustworthy than the banks. They aren't, because they don't answer to governments or shareholders.

jcampbelly,"&gt; I would actually like a decentralized metaverse were anyone can make a site that other people can visit and interact with.

You don't have to use it. There are alternatives. Just because it is the most popular doesn't make it a monopoly. And just because it's not the quality of YouTube doesn't mean it can't serve the same purpose capably.

Replace ""metaverse"" with ""web server"" and I can run an entirely independent web site. I can install VirtualBox, create a VM with a CentOS image, SSH in and run `yum install nginx`, chuck whatever I want into `/usr/share/nginx/html`, and poke a hole through my router to port 80. If I share my IP address with people, I now have a web site on the internet. That's how decentralized and open it is. I just told you how to do it in one paragraph. And every single part of that except for what I pay my ISP for an IP and bandwidth is free.

My point is there will be an open metaverse software one day and after installing it and screwing with the admin dashboard for a few minutes, you'll have a rudimentary, insecure, slow, but privately owned and operated metaverse server independent of the Big Bads. People do this with video game servers and all kinds of open source software very routinely. That might be all I need for my little group of friends or my niche community. Or maybe we pool some resources, buy some hardware, and put it in a colocation facility. We now have our own little metaverse island where Facebook cannot molest us.

Not everybody metaverse is going to be a big public place for rubes to hang out and trade NFTs. Some of us are going to build private virtual spaces that might not look anything at all like VR Chat, but more like makerspaces, workshops, shared software engineering environments, research labs, or whatever else you can imagine and nobody is selling.",hv7dnvf,t1_hv774ru,/r/technology/comments/si36a0/big_tech_needs_to_stop_trying_to_make_their/hv7dnvf/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,0,,,

There's plenty of DeFi available. dSocial apps too. Google it up.

As far as I'm aware it's pretty much a certificate of identification. Just because the NFT stage is filled with with art, doesn't mean that's it's only use. I don't trade using the current NFTs FYI. 

When you buy an NFT, you buy a piece of art(or anything you just purchased) and then they provide you proof of purchase by linking that art to an NFT. The NFT is not the art. You can buy the art without buying it as an NFT, but now who's to say you purchased it? Maybe they could write you a receipt and email it to you, but who's actually going to enforce this receipt? It's possible to forge reciept, how can you verify this receipt is real? People buy art all the time, it's not like there's no use case to owning NFTs. If you want you can not buy art and just take whatever images that are on Google. But saying you can copy and paste NFTs therefore you have the real thing is honestly meaningless. You have the art, but you never got the NFT.

Why buy current NFTs? I haven't really got a reason for that, it's just the current trend. I don't buy art very often so I'm not getting too many NFTs anytime soon.

SlowMotionPanic,"Look, I'm a person who isn't completely against cryptocurrency and its networks. I think there can be real utility in things like dapps as well. However:

&gt;The industry‚Äôs advocates have been making that pitch to the governor for years. The idea is that the miners‚Äô computer arrays would demand so much electricity that someone would come along to build more power plants, something Texas badly needs. **If the grid starts to go wobbly, as it did when winter storm Uri froze up power plants in February 2021, miners could quickly shut down to conserve energy for homes and businesses.** At least two Bitcoin miners have already volunteered to do just that.

&amp;#x200B;

This is complete horseshit and everyone with a brain knows it. Privatizing the grid has proven to be disastrous. Just regulate that shit already. The market *does not* have a shared interest with Texans. Markets only care about maximizing profit at the expense of everything else. As others have said, utility companies won't build out its network; it will just surge pricing like it already does. 

&amp;#x200B;

These duplicitous dirtbags tacitly acknowledge it by preemptively asserting that miners and node operators would voluntarily shut down operations to preserve power in a disaster. That signals the fact that everyone knows the grid won't be made resilient. They wouldn't say that otherwise. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, and this comes from someone who actually owns some targeted crypto (not NFTs), miners and operators will not shut down. Especially for cryptos which support staking, such as the direction ETH is going. You will risk having your entire stake burned depending on how long its offline and the node operations typically performed.

Tasgall,"&gt; The words I want are the words I used

Are you sure? Because I pointed that out because ""irrelevant of Ubisoft"" doesn't make grammatical sense. Did you mean ""irrespective""?

&gt; IDK ask CS:GO skins and how people traded them externally to the game.

They trade through Steam iirc, but it's odd that you'd refer to a successful system with tradeable in-game items as an argument in favor of NFTs when it's just evidence that you don't need NFTs to do this.

&gt; Why is it never going to happen? I have a feeling you're just saying it because you're on some weird anti-NFT binge as if NFTs are hurting you directly.

Well, your feeling is wrong. It's never going to happen because the majority of people running the ETH network make a lot more money from processing fees under the proof of work system than they would under proof of stake, so they're heavily incentivised not to make the switch. It could have happened a year ago, it's already been implemented iirc, it just hasn't switched yet because they have no incentive to do so, and in fact quite a high incentive _not_ to do so. That's just the basic reality of the situation, no ""weird anti-NFT binge"" based on ""feelings"" required. Why do you believe they _are_ switching?

&gt; If you do not want to participate in this, then don't. It is literally that simple.

I mean, I won't? But it seems people not wanting to participate is what is making Mr Ubisoft CEO and all the cryptobros in this thread upset.

&gt; Do the literal minimum of good password management and account security and you'll be fine.

Everyone thinks they'll never get their shit stolen until they do, lol. Plenty of people getting their crypto wallets and NFTs jacked all the time who thought they were invincible the day before.

&gt; Because if you buy a skin season 1 of a game, and now it is season 10, some people want to buy it at an increased cost. If people want to do this, just let them.

Sure, fine. You don't need NFTs to do that though. Again, CS:GO does it, TF2 does it. Tons of games allow for this, it's not a new feature made possible by NFTs.

Tasgall,"&gt; Seriously, just do a little research from an unbiased source. I beg you.

I'd advise the same, because the only people who think it's a good idea are people with a vested interest in selling you cryptocurrency.

&gt; And for the record I did see the advent of DLC and was not happy about games being broken up into pieces to be sold for more $$$.

&gt; NFTs can be used for ownership of unique digital assets

Yes, so, DLC, lol.

&gt; which allows the player to actually OWN the content they are either purchasing OR spending their IRL time acquiring in-game. Rather than have it owned by the publisher/developer and essentially leased to the player to use.

And this is where I think you haven't actually done any of _your_ own research, because what do you think this even means? The way NFTs work doesn't _really_ give you ""digital ownership"" the way it seems you think it does. Do you think you actually own your dumb monkey ""art""? Because you don't, you own a receipt that has an address written on it, that's it. You don't own whatever is at that address, you only own the receipt. The owner of the server the address points to could change it at any time, the server could go down, etc. Same with in-game items - you own a thing that says you own an item, but you're still at the mercy of the server staying up, or the dev not changing how your item works, and the dev not just choosing to blacklist that particular item. The game is still made by the devs, you aren't _really_ disassociating anything from the devs at all compared to an account system managed by the company.

&gt; If anything NFTs can solve the issue of DRM in gaming by giving the ownership back to the consumer, just like when you buy a physical copy of a game.

Except have you actually thought about what that statement even means, or how it would work from a technical aspect? It's not at all like ""when you buy a physical copy of the game"". You won't be able to install the game direct from the blockchain, you'll still need a server to download it from, and one to verify the authentication (the game client can't do that itself, otherwise it could just be modded out, lol).

But back to gamers not liking DRM in the first place, why does this _improve_ DRM and make it desirable? If a company goes tits up, your game still gets perma-locked unless you mod out the authentication scheme. If you want it to be ""like owning a physical copy of the game"" you should be able to just play it.

The other question NFT stans continually fail to understand is that the idea of ""ownership of digital assets"" for most people is _undesirable_. NFTs are only ""good"" if they do something people actually want, and locking down digital assets has always been something people are against. Digital assets are inherently fungible, you can copy an image an infinite number of times for basically nothing and have the last copy be identical to the original. This is the power of media sharing on the internet, it's what made it what it _is_, it's what the entirety of internet culture is based on, and NFTs are the antithesis to that. That's why people don't like them. Well, that, and because they're only ever shoehorned into applications where they add no benefit, lol.",hut5eey,t1_huofxte,/r/technology/comments/seos6e/ubisoft_exec_defends_nfts_saying_players_dont_get/hut5eey/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,0,,,

Along with the zero upside, NFTs also do have some downsides, the biggest of which is that items would be unrecoverable.

Uh, that was you? You're claiming that crypto has no trading fees, which is just false. If you don't want the topic to go somewhere, don't bring it up with a nonsense claim, lol.

&gt; i never said shit about anything being zero so maybe you should just shut up ya dumb dumb

Learn to read before calling people ""dumb dumb"". The issue is claiming BTC using excessive amounts of energy is ok because banks also use energy, but you're not doing a per-transaction comparison. Yes, the entire global banking system uses more total energy than the entire crytpo ecosystem, because the entire crypto ecosystem only manages a tiny, infinitesimal fraction number of transactions in comparison.

And the argument of ""but so much of crypto uses renewables"" is also a tired, bad argument. Energy is mostly fungible, turns out, it doesn't matter that they use renewables if that energy could have otherwise entered the grid to be used elsewhere. That's still an increase in energy demand that will (in most cases) just lead to more fossil fuels being spun up. Yes, in _some_ cases, they're taking unused load by bleeding off excess power from a dam that needs to lower the reservoir or whatever, but that's not the norm.

Also, obviously ""bitcoin.com"" is going to be a biased source, lol - you think they don't have a conflict of interest here? Not at all? Lol.

Hell, NFTs aren't even an authoritative paper trail. People mint NFTs of art they don't own all the time, and the blockchain also can't account for off-chain fraud/theft, e.g. wallet gets stolen. The NFT doesn't even have to be unique - only the internal token is unique, not the metadata, and not the image it points to. And there can be multiple implementations of a given NFT chain

It gets even worse if you dive into it deeper - most NFTs are little more than a link to an asset, often not even including a hash, so if that server goes down / disappears, you can't even validate the NFT is linked to that image. Moreover, the ecosystem is ironically already so centralized that even if it's a server you yourself own, virtually all frontends will just display whatever OpenSea says anyways.

Yeah the regular financial industry uses more energy than bitcoin from offices and computers etc. Bitcoin also incentives green energy usage, can use energy that would have otherwise been wasted and also incentives innovation in energy production types. I think it's a win win considering bitcoin simply just has more features that money should have than fiat. No one can seize you're bitcoin from you as well. Pure property.

&gt;Except government-backed fiat currency has worked for a hundred years, and EVERYBODY is using it.

Everyone's using it not exactly by choice. It's always been the default. However crypto currency probably wouldn't exist if fiat was backed by gold. You have people in Turkey that have no choice to buy bitcoin to save themselves from hyper inflation.  People would definitely use bitcoin as a global currency too. Cross boarder payments are super expensive but with bitcoin you can transfer a billion dollars for like $3. 

One of the things I learnt from researching history of money is that all government issued money has failed eventually. They all end up incorporating inflation since it's legalized theft of your citizens. It goes back to medieval days where kings would coat copper coins in silver as a form of inflation.

NFTs could be minted for the proof of ownership (yes it would likely be tied a serial number for a specific sku but the NFT makes it trackable and tradeable). This then allows you to profit a little off your digital games, similar to GameStops physical trade in. It benefits the user as they can make an intangible asset, effectively tangible as well as make money from the sales of their now tangible assets. It also benefits the game studios as they open up another revenue stream via tradeable digital games. Sure they will Continue to push buying new to edge out the middleman but those would likely be more in the micro transaction side, which isn‚Äôt going away with out without NFTs.

Some will care about the skin and will buy new, making them happy as they cared about the skin and developers happy as they profit likely on a higher margin.

1) You don't need an NFT for this. Implementing trading using a centralized server system is not hard, and the physical infrastructure to do so is already in place (it's used to sell the game digitally in the first place). 

2) Despite the fact that this has been possible for ages, it has not happened. Why, because game devs would much, much rather have 2 people each buying new copies, than 1 person buying a copy and then selling it on. This is why they have used all kind of tricks to stop it.

You could imagine a system where things like characters and skins are part of a common system that many games build off of. Anyone can design skins that can be used in many different games. This makes it easier for you as a game developer to outsource character designs. And it makes it easier for you as a character designer to monetize your art. As a player you get more use out of a skin because you can use it across many games. But you really have to bake this into your game design from the start. It's not just going to magically work with existing systems. For the most part, I think we're still exploring what types of things can be done with NFTs and blockchains in general. Most of the applications of NFTs so far have been shameless cash grabs, but that doesn't mean that is the only thing the tech is capable of.",hurs8g8,t1_hunww26,/r/technology/comments/seos6e/ubisoft_exec_defends_nfts_saying_players_dont_get/hurs8g8/,1,technology,t5_2qh16,r/technology,0,,,

&gt;The computer networking revolution began in the early 1960s and has led us to todayÔøΩs technology. The Internet was first invented for military purposes, and then expanded to the purpose of communication among scientists. The invention also came about in part by the increasing need for computers in the 1960s. During the Cold War, it was essential to have communications links between military and university computers that would not be disrupted by bombs or enemy spies. In order to solve the problem, in 1968 DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) made contracts with BBN (Bolt, Beranek and Newman) to create ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network).

Even NFTs might have some added value in the future, although for the moment I'm really not impressed either (all the NFT ""art"" is pretty much pointless and probably a combination of money laundering and people being tricked into it). Some more realistic uses would be for ticketing or ownership of digital/real goods, but only if the NFT brings an additional value compared to current systems (so far not seen a good advantage of it).

NotATuring,"TBH I'm not really familiar personally with it, I've just read about it online because I thought NFTs would be easy money after hearing about a guy who made a bunch of money selling computer created NFTs.  After reading more about it I realized he was probably either a willing or unwilling patsy for money laundering schemes and I don't think NFTs are a good idea now.  But...  


If you have lots of illegal funds you have several things you need to do to launder it.  Mobsters in the past used to have lots of cash, which they would launder through literal launderettes or strip clubs or casinos.    


This process continues to evolve, and today a lot of it comes from private art auctions, but NFTs are just a new way of doing it.    


There are three stages for laundering.  Placement, layering and Integration.  NFTs might be found at either of these three stages.  Usually when it comes to online laundering no two schemes are the same so these are just examples of what might be being done:  


The specific means of NFT laundering will be different in each case, but some examples are having a person sell NFT items and then you purchase it with illegally obtained funds.  The person who sold it would ideally have no ties to you.  They would sit on that money and eventually give much of it back to you, if they were not caught by law enforcement.  Ideally they would give it back to you in the form of making payments to a legitimate business you own, so that the transaction they make with you is on the up and up but they simply don't actually receive the service.  If this is the case then the NFT would be used as the second to last step in integration.  


Alternatively you may, as the criminal, both purchase and sell the NFT under an assumed alias, and use the funds to make further purchases.  With this the NFT could be in the ""placement"" stage or it could be in the ""layering"" stage.  The layering stage is where you keep shifting your illegal funds around from bull shit thing to bull shit thing hoping to obfuscate the origins of the money.  So you might buy crypto illegally.  If you own the wallet key there's nothing anyone can do to keep you from using those coins however you like (they can only catch you after you use them I mean, since afaik you can't ""freeze"" a crypto address).  So then you might put it into a tumbler service to anonymize that money, then you might take that anonymous crypto and put it into another crypto, maybe one that isn't regulated but can be converted back into a crypto that is usable, then use that crypto to buy some other bull shit like a crypto kitty, so on and so forth, pass the money through more and more bull shit that I would describe as ""bitcoin but with X"" until the path of the money is so long and varied that the money isn't traceable to its origins.  


At which point it is ready for integration, which there are a million ways to do that I suppose.

Plus, relationships are so exhausting, expensive ($, mentally and emotionally) and can get so redundant. 

After my last relationship I had a lot more  T I M E and that is KEY! My weekends were dedicated to ex and once I got those back, I started thriving!! 

I started pursuing my hobbies. I got back into gaming, then got myself a 3D Printer (assembling it was a proud momentüò¢), I taught myself more about CRYPTO/NFTs/Digital Assests and that (still) absorbs my energy..I'm $laying it, just sayin'!! üòéAlso got an Oculus 2, some digital assets, etc. ( the real ones know ü§ë)

Also, I pivoted careers! Left the hospitality industry after over a decade with Marriott (it took such a beating over the pandemic), took some online courses about Digital Marketing, got a new job within the Marketing &amp; Creative realm where I get to WFH (or under a tree, whatevers clever) with a kickass company and am continually learning more about shit that actual interests me (tech).

Lastly, I'm humbled to have kickass friends, family, cat, I own a place (which is damn near impossible in Toronto), drive AND am in optimal health!! I never wanted kids so am I'm no rush to settle down and I love to have F U N!!

mangotree65,"There are so many but three seem most important. The first two don't get enough mention. 

A man who displays strong admiration for celebrity businesspeople and is constantly talking about money and ""success.""  Often, what these people admire about the rich and famous is not their wealth or accomplishments, it's the power they perceive the rich to have over others. Does your date frequently mention being an ""entrepreneur?"" Obsess over cryptocurrency and NFTs? Heap praise on the wealthy while denigrating workers? Have few books but does have a prominently displayed copy of an Ayn Rand novel? If any of those are true you are likely dealing with someone who views and will treat you like a slave. 

Anyone who has a strong relationship with parents who were abusive. If he is willing to overlook past abuse he received, he's going to expect you to do the same for him. If he feels obligated to forgive or assist people solely because they are family, he is telling you he respects arbitrary social order more than reality. This is the type of person who overlooks sexual abuse by clergy and law enforcement. 

How a person treats animals, children, and people in service jobs is a big indicator of selfishness. If they are anything but kind and generous, it's just a matter of time before they display lack of respect for you. 

I'd also give a warning about men who have fallen into the bizarre cult of worship for Jordan Peterson, Joe Rogan, and other ""manly"" types. These are emotionally immature men who are desperate for an authority figure in their lives. This man needs to experience having a parent before they are ready for a partner.

TheProperDave,"It's a complex question with a lot of components and nuances, but the simplest answer is the NFT technology is a journal of who ""owns"" something.

The journal should be distributed across many numbers of machines that maintain the NFT network, to help prove you are the owner. If you sell the work, the network updates to say who now owns the work.

There's a lot of pros and cons to the technology. Like, who actually legally varifies and protects ownership? If you start an NFT network to ""sell"" the content of the Louvre or any major museum, who's to stop you? What happens if the NFT network shuts down?

If you're going to buy into NFTs, those are the things you need to check before spending any money.",i330z8q,t3_tucweu,/r/AskReddit/comments/tucweu/what_are_nfts_exactly/i330z8q/,1,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,0,,,

You stamp data onto the blockchain via an NFT. That data is supposed to be useful data, not digital artwork or memes.

NFTs should be stamped with specific data that allows systems which issue the NFT to inspect it, verify what it means and verify you are the owner.

We have a condition that every time the token is transferred, we receive X% of final sale price when converted to GBP OR if it isn‚Äôt traded within X amount of time, a tax is applied to the holder. The idea is that we will receive more money as time goes on; people will become aware that this token is actually extremely valuable because the business meeting is extremely useful. Because of this, more people will be inclined to buy and hold the token, pushing up our revenue.

The_Law_of_Pizza,"It's the newest version of the old ""buy an acre of land on the moon"" scam.

In the moon scam, some random company just keeps a list of people who have paid, and that list says the purchasers ""own"" an acre of land in the moon - even though this list has no legal authority whatsoever. You're just paying a random company to put you on their own private list that means nothing.

An NFT is a digital token tracked by a random company, which keeps a list of the purchasers. Their list says that the purchasers ""own"" a specific image. For example, pictures of weird monkeys in various costumes. But, just like the moon scam, this list has no legal authority whatsoever. It's just a list kept my some random company. You are paying go be kept on that list, just for the sake of being on the list.

The reason that NFTs are so popular right now is because they're riding the wave of crypto/bitcoin popularity (they use the same technology), and because you can try and get other people to pay you to take your spot on the list. So peoples' gambling instincts kick in.

Artists have a lot of the same complaints you do. What we're upset by are scammers. They are ""draining the liquidity from the market"" as they say. Artist sales are way down because amateur collectors get duped into buying the collectible garbage.

Low effort hustlers have flooded the market and our social media platforms. Its confusing new buyers into spending money despite a poor understanding of what they're getting into. As a result, fewer people actually go looking for legitimate art sold as nfts. Before all the Bored Apes, etc, in 2020 to early 2021, the NFT world centered around a legitimate artistic movement. Now its a cesspool of scams and the artists are hanging on for dear life.

On your other point, people shouldnt refer to artworks as NFTs. It shows a low understanding of the tech you're working with. I personally avoid speaking about my artworks as ""nfts"" because it shows a poor understanding of the tech, and I'm trying to attract savvy collectors, not fast-money FOMO buyers. When I talk about my collection i refer to my nft artworks, to distinguish assets from jpegs. Some collectors dont care about technical expertise if they can tell the artist has a bright career ahead of them.

NFTs cant be limited as you suggest because they dont have a specific use. Saying they should be limited to big companies is like saying it should be illegal to resell an autographed baseball card. There are many types of NFTs including art, memberships, tickets, legal contracts, transferrable asset baskets and more.

Scammers are despicable but everywhere on earth theres an opportunity to make money, scammers will appear. Theres scammers in every economy. Artists and collectors report scams to platforms as soon as they find them. Its hard to keep up at this point. 

In my opinion, NFTs themselves arent the problem -- they're merely a technology for owning, transferring and selling an item's digital representation. The problem is that scammers are running rampant to the point that its really detrimentally affected the NFT art market and shifted everyones attention towards these generated collections. Caveat emptor, people should never believe promises of riches based on buying an NFT. Buying expecting to make a profit is gambling. 

I only buy artwork NFTs from artists whose work I really like I can tell are going to keep working. I build personal relationships with the people I buy from and the collectors I sell my own work to. People should do this more and gamble with cartoons less! ü§£",i2cjklk,t1_i27s47g,/r/AskReddit/comments/tnkzd9/antinft_redditors_what_would_have_to_change_about/i2cjklk/,1,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,0,,,

InnocentHeathy,Ugh My husband getting into NFTs was the last straw that led to our upcoming divorce. He made a lot of money with it (and no we weren't rich in the first place). I told him that we can't rely on NFT or crypto money as income. We need to budget according to our income from our regular jobs. I thought he listened to me and trusted him when he presented me with a budget and plan to buy a nice house only using his NFT money as a down payment. A few months in and I realized that he fudged the numbers on that budget. He was planning on using NFT/crypto but knew I wouldn't agree. Now it seems the bubble has popped and we're losing money every month. I've come up with a solution to get us out of this but there's a divorce along with it. And I'm not sure how much of that crypto / NFT money he'll have left when we're on the other end of this.

to make matters worse, the actual artists are having a tough time making ends meet because all the ""investors"" buy into these scams now for some reason. Artist single-editions are not selling as well as they did a year ago, before the apes launched.

Regarding the ""universally free"" aspect, theres an interesting movement of NFT projects embracing Creative Commons CC0 licensing.

190bpm,"This is a pretty inaccurate explanation. I'll respond one sentence at a time.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The picture just represents the NFT.

Correct, the NFT is not a picture. It is an irrevocable digital token which links to metadata which points to a url containing a picture.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The NFT itself is just a bit of data on a server.

The NFT itself is actually on the blockchain, which is a network of servers around the world. It will never exist only on a single server. However you're partially right in a technical sense -- most people think of NFTs as the image, whereas its just a link to metadata. That metadata is usually hosted on a server. So is the image. Smart creators put these on IPFS which ensures that the data will remain available even if the original content server goes down. BUT most major NFT platforms put their metadata and images on centralized servers, completely negating the entire purpose of the NFT, and leaving the use at risk of having NFTs with images that will disappear someday.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; You buy the ability to stand at a place in a line, and you get to look at the picture from where you're standing.

I dont know where to being with this, its just some weird made up thing you said

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Its literally nothing.

Sometimes this is true. People buy the image, but given the centralized server issue i mentioned, that can be removed. So yeah, some people have bought soemthing which turned out to be nothing.

definitely. when i was younger and really into digital art, i would draw character designs (just colorful cats/dogs with sparkles and wings and stuff lol) and ""trade"" them with other people for art or actual $$$ or other character designs, which 13 year old me treated as ""investments"" because i could sell them later on for even more money lmao (i think i ended up making like $750 off of this, which isn't bad considering the fact that i never spent a cent originally...i just drew pictures)

NFTs immediately reminded me of character swapping when i first heard about them. you'd think that paying for pixels on a screen would be an unpopular idea, but the art community is *huge* and the same idea has been successful before. NFTs are just executing this idea really horribly because of their limitations",i1qwnh7,t1_i1qnyk7,/r/AskReddit/comments/tk1ov5/what_isnt_considered_a_cult_but_feels_culty/i1qwnh7/,1,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,0,,,

Now, this is honestly really similar to how land ownership works - you have a deed document that says you own this land because you or some original owner called dibs on it in the past.

Yeah, nfts are weird and the technology should really be applied for things better than art reproductions but have you ever seen an expensive reprints of famous photographs or paintings? Mother fuckers wanna charge more that $20 for something that can literally be printed but people still buy them and it's generally accepted as a fine thing to do.





For the people who unintentionally became memes, they honestly deserve the money. Imagine minding your own business and then suddenly a million Middle Class American Facebook Mom's‚Ñ¢ use a picture of you to send around in a way that boils down to mocking because you accidentally did something cringey or they just think you look funny.





Looked at gifs on messenger and one of the first ones was a clearly disabled guy, ultimately minding his own business. Bro, imagine being the face of a gif that people send around to make fun of their friends just because you have a disability and decided to go outside.

gourley4p,"From Forbes (https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/nft-non-fungible-token/):  

An NFT is a digital asset that represents real-world objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. They are bought and sold online, frequently with cryptocurrency, and they are generally encoded with the same underlying software as many cryptos....

NFTs are also generally one of a kind, or at least one of a very limited run, and have unique identifying codes. ‚ÄúEssentially, NFTs create digital scarcity,‚Äù says Arry Yu, chair of the Washington Technology Industry Association Cascadia Blockchain Council and managing director of Yellow Umbrella Ventures.

My words:

190bpm,"That's sort of the outsider's 10,000 ft view of what NFTs are. In ten years ppl will look back at this cartoon clubhouse NFT mania and wonder what they were all thinking. 

It's merely a digital token linking to it's content and it's owner. 

It's really early for the tech in general, and the hypetrain jumped on board NFTs before they were very mature. For that reason it's really silly for your average person to get involved if they're not knowledgeable or interested in learning about crypto.

Inside the NFT creator world, actual artists are having a tough time making sales lately because these cartoon scam collections are stealing all the attention! 

There's also a really big healthy art community that doesn't ever get talked about. Like, artists selling to other artists at reasonable prices.. Check out objkt.com for example.

The question was how do *NFTs* ensure it's not misinformation.  

&gt;""Because it's been vetted.""

Right, a vetting process that NFTs have *absolutely nothing* to do with.  They don't prove something is factually right or inherently prevent misinformation. Thanks for walking right into making my point for me.

Yet another claim of something they don't actually provide any benefit for by another crypto-zealot.  It doesn't create, ensure, or help any vetting process at all.  You're just slapping NFTs on the end of a prrocess that isn't remotely a new idea and acting like they're going to somehow make that process infallible.

What a childishly naive idea.  We're back to the same problem.  *Anyone* can ""vet"" and pass off misinformation and then slap an NFT on it at the end.  I'm not sure *you* understand NFTs.

Also, just ignoring all the other major issues I cited doesn't make them stop being issues, it just tells me that you have no good answer for why you'd introduce all their problems while not really providing any benefit.",i1eqm3r,t1_i1dpy5x,/r/AskReddit/comments/ti1s5d/without_revealing_your_age_what_is_something_from/i1eqm3r/,1,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,r/AskReddit,0,,,

Mithrawndo,"It's more insidious than that.

NFTs are merely a receipt on the blockchain, and will only have any *real* worth - as opposed to speculative value - if/when they (and the specific blockchain they are ""minted"" on) become widely accepted as authoritative. This gives early adopters a vested interest in ensuring that acceptance as widely as possible, remarkably similar (but not the same) as a pyramid or ponzi scheme might; They become evangelists for that ""faith"".

To understand why this is such a divisive issue, one must understand that the internet is fundamentally built on collectivist (*communist*) principles. Our real-world economies understandably work on the principles of scarcity - though ironically of course are not zero-sum as this might imply - whilst digital data can be replicated an infinite number of times with no cost. As an example, there's only a finite amount of wheat the human race can cultivate in a given year, but there's no theoretical limit to how often we might duplicate and how widely we can disseminate the instructions on how to cultivate wheat.

For some, this is a strength of our digital platforms. For others, NFTs are themselves as a solution to this problem.

SeventhSolar,"The WoW token isn't RMT.  Money goes into the game and is converted into in-game assets.  But I digress.

The point of an NFT is to allow people to buy and sell them without permissions from anyone.  If a game allows people to buy and sell only within the ""ecosystem""...

What's the ecosystem?  Is it just in-game interfaces?

Right, anyway, if the only thing differentiating NFTs in a video game from a server tracking what items a player owns is the ability to sell without the developer facilitating it, then why NFTs?  Why doesn't the developer just use a database like every other game developer in existence?  What functionality does the NFT introduce?

On the topic of RMT, it has nothing to do with control.  I have seen two forms of RMT ruining games.  First, RMT introduces wealth as power into a space that's supposed to be about fun.  You pay sixty dollars for Elden Ring, you get the same opportunities for fun as everyone else.  But in a play-to-win environment (being able to buy power), players are forced to struggle with the temptation of shelling out hundreds or thousands of dollars for a more complete experience.  Both players and developers hate people buying boosted accounts because it ruins matches or other cooperative events where people are forced to play with players far below their skill level.  In mobile phone games, the top accounts are whales, players who spent tens of thousands of dollars to buy collections that can't otherwise exist.  But both of these examples involve stable prices.  When you introduce NFTs into the mix, you now have an actual, public market.  Demand will drive the prices to wild levels.  Where whales were once limited by the maximum amount of money that can be spent before the game runs out of content, now they compete with each other in bidding wars.

The other half of the issue of RMT is people playing-to-earn.  The WoW token is an example of how developers keep the auction house *in-game*.  No game allows players to extract real money, or they risk creating situations like Axie Infinity, where players turned the game into a job, creating perverse incentives and damaging the game economy.  As a PoE player, I'm intimately familiar with this kind of RMT.  At one point in PoE (it feels like the devs have managed to get the issue under control in recent leagues), currency was sold through RMT sites against ToS.  Because there was a monetary incentive to play, botting occurred.  The bots competed with the market for certain cheap magic find items, ruining the experience for new players who wanted those items.  Bots also flooded the chat channels with increasingly unreadable RMT advertisements (there was a constant arms race between them and the chat filters).

The ideal game is one which involves as little money as possible, but the gaming industry has been ruined by greed and NFTs are just the logical conclusion.",i2lptza,t1_i2lfs6i,/r/technews/comments/tqk739/ukraine_has_launched_an_nft_museum_to_preserve/i2lptza/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,0,,,

SeventhSolar,"I play PoE.  The microtransaction structure incentivized the developers to eventually introduce a lootbox.  It was an incredibly stripped down implementation, about as non-exploitative as the developers could make it, and we trust the developers implicity.  The relationship between PoE players and devs is stronger than in most games, and *that's* why there's only light grumbling about the lootboxes.  It's not *liked*, but it's accepted as mostly inoffensive.  We buy the microtransactions with the mindset that PoE is an incredible game and we're willing to spend hundreds of dollars on meaningless skins to support the devs.  Microtransactions are a sacrifice, something distasteful that we accept as inevitable for any business looking to make more money.

Tobydog30,"The only ways to make money off NFTs is to: 

1. Get in early to a limited drop that is from a big brand. These sell out very quickly and then the price begins to rise once there are no more in stock. Then you sell it to someone who thinks they can still flip it for profit. This is pretty hard to do since they sell out very fast. Then you need to time the sell because the hype dies down fast. I‚Äôm also pretty sure the only reason these have any ‚Äúvalue‚Äù is because the brands releasing them are big and established such as luxury fashion brands. 

2. Make your own NFT collection. Gameify it since those seem to do better than artistic ones. Build hype around it and sell them for about $50-100 a piece. Hopefully people bite the bait and you make some sort of profit.

Personally I think NFT‚Äôs are really dumb. Blockchain technology is great and I think that has many potential good uses. NFTs are not one of them in my opinion. 

The receipt that you get for purchasing an NFT doesn‚Äôt even include the NFT, simply a date, maybe some credentials and a pointer to where the image is located. Basically it‚Äôs a receipt with a url on it. 

If the server that hosts that url goes down, if someone changes what content is on the domain that the url points to, etc. Your ‚ÄúNFT‚Äù is gone. Which means that the best way to preserve your NFT, is to ironically DOWNLOAD A COPY OF IT.

I think the speculation with the current wave of NFTs will fade with time, but maybe they won't.

Any of the remaining important historical pieces need to be kept as far out of Russia's reach as possible.

Sanuzi,"Oh, I didn't know it reduces the complexity of the puzzle too. That's pretty cool. Where did you see that btw?

Ah yes. As for nfts, I'll first touch on the issues with the images. The big issue with using nfts to point to an http link, is as you would expect, that link can go down, or it can be changed without any record of what, or why, or by who. Enter a new decentralized concept; decentralized file systems. These are mechanisms that provide decentralized data storage off chain (I. E not on any blockchain). IPFS for example. It is a peer to peer protocol, providing decentralized data storage via user nodes that hold a portion of the shared data. The only way to view (or host) files on the network is to act as a node, so the incentive is there. Once a file is uploaded, it's accessible via an ID that can never change. These sort of technologies allow for direct ownership of images, since the hyperlink in this case can't go down. It been adopted widely yet though, so it's WIP

As for using nfts for everything. Yes, this is possible. The basic concept of an nft is that each one has a completely unique ID assigned to it, making it indistinguishable from the rest. If a blockchain technology supporting nfts exists that a whooe industry buys into, companies within that industry can create nfts to denote legally binding contracts, including ownership of real world objects. There may not be any need to link to any data off chain in this case, instead including some metadata in the nft itself detailing what the token itself represents. That's my understanding of it anyways",i2bdi0e,t1_i273v98,/r/technews/comments/tom9ky/ukraine_is_selling_nfts_to_support_its_military/i2bdi0e/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,0,,,

FaceDeer,"&gt; Uh, first, the ability to sell tickets directly to fans as existed long before NFTs were ever around. 

Sure, but this would be a new way of doing it that supports features that the older ways did not. NFTs can be transferred directly over the internet in a fraud-proof manner, most obviously. That's their core feature.

&gt; Second, people have been talking about displacing Ticketmaster for decades.

I don't know what point you're trying to make here. I'm not saying Ticketmaster would necessarily be completely obsoleted by NFTs, lock stock and barrel. I'm saying that NFTs can support an alternative to Ticketmaster. If Ticketmaster's services provide sufficient value-add that it's worth the fees to use them, then sure, go ahead and use them. Otherwise, sell your tickets some other way. Maybe as NFTs.

The goal isn't to drive Ticketmaster out of business, it's to give people more tools in their toolbox. If Ticketmaster can't compete with them, oh well, too bad for Ticketmaster. If it can, all the better - it means Ticketmaster's providing good value. Competition is good, yes?

And I should note, this is all still just one single example off the top of my head of a useful application of NFTs. If somehow it turns out that Ticketmaster is just so incredibly awesome and cheap that everyone always uses them forevermore, and would have been even if there wasn't the possibility of competition from NFT tickets, that still doesn't necessarily mean NFTs are useless overall. There's other applications. This is just the first one that popped to my mind in particular.

&gt; What you‚Äôre saying is eerily reminiscent of what people called ‚Äúopen-source businesses‚Äù that Bitcoin would make possible.

It is reminiscent of that because it's the same basic thing. The difference is that Bitcoin failed to accomplish it. Bitcoin is not technologically sophisticated enough to support the sorts of applications needed for replacing middlemen like these, and the userbase of Bitcoin became too conservative to continue developing the new features that were necessary to do this. Bitcoin ossified into its current ""digital gold"" form that's fairly useless for anything except price speculation.

Bitcoin doesn't support smart contracts or NFTs like modern blockchains do. So obviously, it can't do these sorts of things that are now more easily possible via smart contracts and NFTs. That's why NFTs have suddenly become popular now, as opposed to back in 2013. The technology didn't support them very well back in 2013. The possibility was anticipated, it just happened to be realized by blockchains other than Bitcoin itself.",i29cyyq,t1_i299cy5,/r/technews/comments/tom9ky/ukraine_is_selling_nfts_to_support_its_military/i29cyyq/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,0,,,

FaceDeer,"I'll give an actual answer. NFT stands for ""non-fungible token."" [Fungibility](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fungibility.asp) is ""the ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type.""

For example if you have a dollar and I have a dollar and we put them in a pile together it doesn't mater which dollar was mine and which was yours - dollars are fungible. If we put the keys to our cars in a pile, though, it *does* matter which key is which. Car keys are not fungible.

You can have this in cryptocurrency as well. Fungible tokens are things like Bitcoin, where the ""identity"" of any given bitcoin token doesn't matter. If I sell something for X bitcoin tokens I don't care *which* tokens I get, as long as I get X amount of them.

Non-fungible tokens actually ""represent"" a specific unique thing in some manner. For example, you could have an NFT that represents a specific seat in a stadium for a specific sporting event. If you own that token they'll let you into the stadium to view the event, if you don't own that token you won't be allowed in.

Right now most NFTs on the market are of less practical utility than that, they're generally treated more as ""trading cards"". People ""mint"" NFTs that represent abstract things, like a particular image or event, and then sell them to people who simply want to be able to say ""I own the NFT representing that thing and nobody else does.""

_ArtosisCurse_,"Weil that would be a fucking long ass comment but I will try to keep this short. 

NFTs allow you to own digital items. This is becoming important in a time where we spend our lives increasingly online. Web 1 only allowed you to read and watch the stuff other people out online, web 2 allowed you to interact with things like Reddit and web 3 will allow you not only to interact but also own the content you created. Social media earn millions on the back of content creators who get jack shit, NFTs can help change that. 

They can also be used to make quite a few existing systems much more faire. For example tickets which could be created as NFTs in a way that they can not be resold thus helping to fight people who buy in bulk to screw over fans. 

They could also help improve the position of gamers. Gamers spend more and more money every year on digital items that they have zero control over and often can‚Äôt even resell. Items as NFTs would allow you to trade them on any market you wanted to and to get some of your money back once you decide to leave the game. 

There current uses cases of ugly jpegs is pretty cringe and scammy but honestly so is the traditional art market. 

Nfts have a lot of potential as long as you believe that digital items can have value which i believe.",i270ldu,t1_i26z8k0,/r/technews/comments/tom9ky/ukraine_is_selling_nfts_to_support_its_military/i270ldu/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,0,,,

Blockchains are good for one thing, and one thing only. They ensure data integrity and validation. The problem is that NFTs and other blockchain based ownership/validation systems are horribly horribly awful when it comes to scale.

--SOURCE--,"The math there is my issue. 5 people bought the game and the dev only made $76, whereas in Steam even with their current 30% cut, the dev would have made $210 after 5 sales. You could argue that maybe because the price is cheaper, it would attract more players and thus more sales occurring. But the flip side is Steam itself is an active, reputable market with millions of users, indie devs will get more eyes on their product on Steam vs going solo and paying for advertising. 

This would probably impact story based games a lot more too. If Elden Ring was a NFT for example, they'd get 1M purchases or so first month with no cut which is obviously a huge amount of money. But down the road as people finish the game and choose to sell, there will be a point where the demand for the game is less than the number of NFTs in circulation. NFT resale market will become increasingly competitive, driving NFT prices down, giving even less reason to directly buy from the dev. Games that are expected to have a 2 to 3 year life cycle will see profits come to a trickle within the first year.

This could be a movie rental like old-school Blockbuster. You rent the NFT which has an embedded use period, say a 14 day rental, during which you can view the movie.

This would attract creators away from traditional means of game distribution, like it's current state of only new sales and no transferability. It works now, but what if there's no Steam-equivalent dominance because indie creators (hell, could even be AAA studios) start applying a direct-to-consumer model now that they don't need to manage licencing since that's on the blockchain. Yeah, the blockchain does cost money to interact with, but so does every financial system out there... Steam takes a 15% fee for peer-to-peer item sales for example.

Maybe it's a car title. Maybe it's a membership card (e.g. Costco). Maybe it's *anything* that you want to track individually without replication potential. 

We're too early in the applications to see how and where this will be implemented fully.

ScientificBeastMode,"I mean sure, but what you‚Äôre describing as an MLM is not actually what‚Äôs happening in crypto right now. Are NFTs overly hyped? Yes? Would I ever buy a $1M NFT? Hell no, even if I had the money‚Ä¶

But there are numerous examples of people who have a crypto punk or a bored ape who have never sold. Some of them have publicly explained that they really like the NFT, and that it means enough to them that they don‚Äôt ever plan on selling.

An MLM is about direct marketing and direct recruiting. The NFT market is nothing like that. It‚Äôs just not even close. It‚Äôs just an over-hyped asset class, and it‚Äôs only over-hyped because it‚Äôs new and because the insane prices cause quite a buzz in popular culture. That‚Äôs all there is to it.

The fact is, there is no such thing as ‚Äúintrinsic value.‚Äù If intrinsic value were real, then one might think oxygen would be the most valuable thing on earth. And in one sense it is. If we suddenly didn‚Äôt have it, it would become a priceless commodity. But because it‚Äôs plentiful, it‚Äôs basically worthless.

Scarcity and desire are ultimately what drive prices for everything in the world, and ‚Äúdesire‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to have anything to do with ‚Äúusefulness‚Äù or ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù or anything else. Sometimes people just want the digital equivalent of owning a Rolex, something that is worth a lot mostly because it serves as a status symbol. And that‚Äôs not nothing. That‚Äôs pretty rational, tbh. We will see if NFTs retain their ‚Äúcool factor‚Äù over the long term, but there is no denying that they have cultural relevance and that people find them genuinely valuable.",hxuvncf,t1_hxuep52,/r/technews/comments/sx5n50/17_million_in_nfts_stolen_in_apparent_phishing/hxuvncf/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,r/technews,0,,,

CouchRadish,"Blockchain transactions are all technically ‚Äúequal‚Äù in the sense that without a governing figure (like intermediary sites like OpenSea) to dictate which are trades, purchases, and sells, all transactions are just recorded on the blockchain at the same level as each other.

The actual data each node can hold is pretty small (not enough to store photos which is why most NFTs are just hyperlinks to an image stored on a separate server) but programs, also known as ‚Äúsmart contracts‚Äù can be stored and executed on the blockchain. These programs can also be malicious phishing programs that transfer the contents of one‚Äôs wallet to another wallet. And since you can‚Äôt **remove** items that are in your wallet or on the blockchain, the only way you can truly remove it is by paying money to send it to another wallet. Middle managers let you hide the item from your page, but it‚Äôs still there in your wallet.

Tenac1ousP,"There is an exploit in OpenSea‚Äôs system that allowed people to make fake contracts for the buying and selling of a token. In all honesty the people who had their property stolen should have been more careful. Essentially a scammer could send a contract to buy a token that‚Äôs missing some info they‚Äôd later manipulate using the exploit. (At least from what I read in the article)

I never want to victim blame but accepting half filled in documentation for the sale of ANYTHING is stupid. It‚Äôs a bummer people found this scam buttttttt it‚Äôs also kind of on the people not doing their do diligence. Most people have such a lose understanding of NFTs they just buy in to make a quick flip and end up getting scammed or losing profit because, well, it‚Äôs a weird market. 

I get people not liking NFTs. They are 100% a luxury purchase and most are just .jpegs you lose eth on. That being said, some have practical uses that get you into bars to drink for free, access to password protected markets, etc. Others are just silly and you can buy merch to say ‚Äúsup‚Äù to that one other person you see wearing a shirt.

They looked at me like an idiot when they said their NFTS would be special and grant the IP rights to buyers, and I asked ""which ones""?

Crypto bros: ""All of them""

Me: ""So we won't be allowed to continue to show them on our site after they're sold? Or use one that's sold in our marketing?""

CB: ""Well no, we want that obviously.""

Me: ""What about derivative works? Since these are all algorithmically generated that could put us in a tough spot legally when we do the second edition you've got on your roadmap.""

I eventually convinced them to bring in a lawyer specialized in IP to look over their plans, and that was when they realized that I wasn't just being a dick about it for no reason.

Like they didn't even consider or comprehend that you can have different levels of IP rights, and what it would mean to give up ""total"" ownership of an IP.

kameecoding,"&gt; To answer, why Blockchain, it is far less dev time and a completely interoperable system with any other blockchain stuff that comes out.

far less dev time than what? how do you know it's far less dev time, have you ever done any software development at all?

&gt;  It's a message protocol like tcp/ip we use daily - just no one cares aha. 

I am not sure you understand what tcp/ip is.

&gt; In short I'm most excited for digital ownership of my in game cosmetics 

Does't trading NFTs require you to add a new transfer to the blockchain wherein it goes from one wallet to the other?

quick google search says: 

&gt; The fee to transfer an NFT can cost anywhere from 50¬¢ to $15.00. 

are you going to pay this, or who is going to pay this fee, would be the buyer, that means everything is much more expensive.

&gt; I just wanna sell my old shitty hearthstone cards cause the game sucks lol. 

Who's gonna buy shitty old cards with the added cost of the NFT transfer?

&gt;  or just leave that game cause blizzard ruins everything

so in this hypothetical scenario you want to leave a game that has become garbage, who is going to buy the stuff from you that is now for a garbage game?

&gt; Why blockchain is because believe it or not so many blockchains are out there it is less development time to create this trading system. It's affordable as hell with layer 2 scaling. 

Is it affordable? wouldn't this mean the company would have to each item when selling it, aka paying the ""gas"" fees on every item, why would they do that?

&gt; Free market would make shitty legendaries cheap

you have no idea how the market would behave, it would follow supply demand

&gt; Mostly tho steam marketplace doesn't let you pull out your money through a legitimate way.

yeah, it could quickly become nightmarish, someone gets their account hacked, they sell all their shit on the community market, withdraw money to their bank account.

Now original owner has contacted steam support, they notice what happened, they can reverse the transactions, but there is no balance to refund the buyers, Valve would have to eat that cost or they could just restore the items to the original account, but now the market is affected by duplicated items, driving down prices for everyone.

Now this is in a closed system, where ownership is clear, identified and stuff can be easily modified.

now what happens when your fucking wallet gets hacked and they sell all your Hearthstone legendary cards? who is gonna give it back to you? there is no you, there is only a hash  identifying your wallet, even if there was a way to create a central authority, say Valve gets put in charge because they have impeccable support, they would have to somehow transfer it back to you / mint new stuff to replace your stuff, which is again, additional cost, you think that's gonna happen?

then you might say, you are not stupid, you are not gonna have your wallet stolen, hard drive corrupted, password lost or other ways you can lose your wallet, but then I would point you to your own words:

And besides steam marketplace takes a fairly big cut and I don't believe the game developers get anything out of that transaction? I may be wrong. Mostly tho steam marketplace doesn't let you pull out your money through a legitimate way. It's all 3rd party and I got scammed as a kid lol.

BangThatsWild,"I‚Ä¶quite literally just explained to you why you would not get a forged baseball card that you found in the attic past an authentication expert. 

I don‚Äôt claim to be a tech or mathematics expert, but I sometimes have to review digitally signed contracts and I‚Äôm aware of the existence of hashing algorithms and how blockchains function for validation and security purposes. It‚Äôs good for things like contracts and account authentication because, in the event of a questionable situation, there would be real proof of who did what and when from a digital standpoint. 

I suppose a really motivated NFT owner could go out of their way to prove they are the original and rightful owner of an image but how many times? I mean as it stands currently, anyone can screenshot and copy an image so if all a person wants is to have that image for their collection, it‚Äôs pretty easy to do. 

Why collect something completely intangible that can be copied that easily where the only way to verify that it was, in fact, yours is to take legal action against anyone who screenshots an image? That sounds exhausting. Stealing art is wrong but a person can‚Äôt fight the entire internet if the entire internet decides they want to screenshot the monkey pic and say it‚Äôs their monkey pic. 

In contrast, actual, tangible collectibles are difficult to replicate because they tend to be either:

A) one of a kind custom pieces where creating any sort of exact replica would require physically getting ahold of the physical item and painstakingly making a physical knockoff and hope the actual owner/artist/vendor/fans don‚Äôt notice. I‚Äôve seen some terrible knockoffs of work by rather obscure artists I like. It‚Äôs laughable how bad they are. 

OR  

B) mass produced things that have a finite number of items in existence so when a new one pops up on the market, enough information exists for seasoned collectors, authenticity experts, legitimate auction houses etc. to validate if it is real. Like a real life block chain. People who work in museums have been doing it for centuries.

NFTs can force a % of a sale to go directly to the publisher of a game. They can bake resale into the asset transfer programmatically. That's very enticing for publishers to expand their sale footprint - there's a reason the used game market is a thing.

NFT game chain can be created on a marketplace by the publisher.

Download server solutions remains the same. They just have to host it somewhere, that's easy in the world of cloud. Hosting platforms like steam could even have an autopayment baked into the chain per download. This is not a difficult problem to solve.

You can buy on a marketplace. ERC 20 and ERC 721 protocols allow for this, there just needs to be a flashy user intuitive site to buy and sell. That's coming (GameStop).

No, it isn‚Äôt in their best interest, and I‚Äôll explain why.  

As it stands right now *there is no used games or resale market*.  This argument hinges entirely on the big players in the industry allowing resale of digital games.  Right now, anytime someone wants a game they have to pay in full.  Their profit margins will be *significantly* lower if they allowed resale and took just a percentage of the price.

I‚Äôm prepared to eat crow, but I am convinced that no games company will *ever* allow the resale of a digital game as it will only hurt their margins.

And all that besides‚Ä¶ **If companies wanted to allow you to re-sell a game they could already do that before the advent of NFTs.**  It‚Äôs not like the technology wasn‚Äôt there before NFTs; there is just no profit incentive to do so.

Somewhere that's protected by their EULAs that's going to take advantage of the situation or a marketplace that lets me buy directly from artists.  I know that's not main stream yet, but it has the potential to be. Artists digital assets can be hosted on servers separate from corporate entities trying to capitalize off of their IP.  I think as time moves on and NFTs become a success you'll see more and more independent artists thriving in this manner.

It‚Äôs fine to be weary and skeptical but your argument that I don‚Äôt understand gaming is completely misguided.

The reason for the NFT also has implications for the metaverse.   Like I said earlier, those new Nike's you bought or the new Rolex you got you can now wear in the metaverse.  That's just one small example of an NFTs functionality.

All sorts of business deals could be handled with smart contracts.  House ownership like you mentioned, could also be a part of this.  Your deed to your house could come as an NFT, that would be impossible to forge.

As far as business goes, imagine a world where rather than forming an IPO, a company can mint their own NFT and raise capital that way.  As a sort of decentralized stock market.

There‚Äôs so much noise on the internet coming from competitors, paid shills, influencers and random eedjits on the internet with 0 imagination who don‚Äôt know what the fuck they are talking about that it‚Äôs hard to get a creative or complex idea out there and make money, that‚Äôs what marketers are for.

On the other hand with an NFT discord community, you‚Äôre free social media activity that you regularly engage with can bring in potential investors. People that like your community who want to see it grow. 

Money is power and all the money is controlled by a few, what you‚Äôre seeing with NFT communities like bored apes is a form of tribalism. All those people who own jpegs of monkeys? Those idiots.

LongjumpingMessage36,"Most NFT's are something on the blockchain that says ""I own the thing located at this URL: XXX , and here is a hash of that thing: XXX"".  That's really it.  

When they are ""minted"", or first put on the blockchain, you can then trace transfers of that specific NFT from person to person to see who owns it.  

There is nothing stopping me from finding an NFT I like, copying it's contents, and puttingit into a new NFT: ""I own the thing located at this URL: XXX , and here is a hash of that thing: XXX"". 

I'm not super familiar with how the process works, but it still seems to me like you would need a trusted authority to only mint one of any given NFT.  I assume when game companies are thinking about NFTs for their games, when someone claims ownership of an NFT they check both the ownership (on the blockchain) as well as checking who created it and verifying with that issuer (to make sure it's authentic).  If they're just looking at what's in the NFT itself without verifying ""authenticity"", then anyone could copy an NFT's contents and mint a new NFT that's exactly the same, assuming this is on a public blockchain (which it probably won't be because it's prohibitively expensive to have to pay $5 to create each and every NFT).  

It's true that blockchain is interesting, but I expect people to lose a lot of money.  The two main situations I can think of where crypto is worth it is 1) money laundering / illegal stuff (though not all crypto is good for that), and 2) if you need to get your money out of an unstable currency (crypto is actually more stable than some countries' currency right now, whcih is scary), especially if you can get good USD stablecoin.  Even those uses are dependent on countries not making crypto illegal.",hwwolwb,t1_hwvk3yg,/r/technews/comments/ss1iwd/nft_marketplace_halts_transactions_due_to_rampant/hwwolwb/,1,technews,t5_2qi4j,,0,,,

Like a big ledger that anyone can write in, but with multiple copies that people write on and compare every so often to make sure we're all on the same page.

So the NFT is not the stupid monkey jpeg, it's the entry in the ledger that says ""JoeBordom owns monkey jpeg #49044"".

joycey-mac-snail,"Hi business owner here. It‚Äôs really hard to set up a business that works, not as easy as you might think and it definitely costs a lot more than selling NFTs on opensea. 

First expense is the website, about ¬£250 for the year from wix not including extras. Adversting my business through wiz cost me about ¬£1000 and I did not receive much benefit from that at all. Then with the website you need to get it SEO ready, you can diy yourself or hiring a professional who knows what they‚Äôre doing could run you up to ¬£2500 - I just don‚Äôt have that kind of money. All that before I‚Äôve even sold anything. That‚Äôs not including government registration of a company, data protection and so on. 

Credit is also not that easy to get if you are like me and having almost nothing. I‚Äôm 28 I don‚Äôt own my home, I had less than a ¬£1000 in saving when I started. I would have had to implicate my family as a surety in order to get credit. Luckily the bank and got me 8k at 24% per annum that I will spend the next 4 years paying off. 

If you compare that experience with opensea which cost only $200 in ETH and I can mint and sell however many NFTs I coz that was the gas fees of the day. It‚Äôs really no contest. With NFTs you can set up and finance your ideas with next to nothing and naturally build your community around them. Detractors really just see jpegs and don‚Äôt understand the possibilities that can come with them. They see the scams which are out there and not good and think that‚Äôs all it is.

MusicalAnomaly,"They are. The headline is misleading. I don‚Äôt even need to read the article to tell you the problem is people carelessly purchasing NFTs without verifying the source, which despite being technically trivial to do is not at all common in the current NFT ‚Äúculture‚Äù.

Technically speaking, the only value an NFT has is dependent on a cryptographic signature that can be verified as issued by the owner of a keypair. So if there were a fictional Katy Perry NFT, miss KP would publish her public key on twitter or her website or something, and then a buyer could verify that a given NFT was issued by Katy Perry. Almost no one does this currently; instead they buy NFTs based on imagery used to market them and they assume that the currently centralized marketplaces are verifying issuer identities.

As with everything blockchain; trust no one unless you have a mathematically verifiable reason to. The reason people are getting scammed is because they have put their trust in a centralized marketplace instead of verifying their assumptions for themselves. Blockchain has never claimed to offer anything more than this. It is powerful, and therefore dangerous.",hwvlqd4,t1_hwvjw82,/r/technews/comments/ss1iwd/nft_marketplace_halts_transactions_due_to_rampant/hwvlqd4/,10,technews,t5_2qi4j,,1,,,

Great, log into your account, there it is. Want to make it rare? Great, it‚Äôs only available today, we‚Äôre only selling 100 or 5 or 1.

Making in-game items into NFTs would be nice for the user because then they can buy and sell them on a digital marketplace, but do game companies want that? Wouldn‚Äôt it already exist if they did? Diablo 3 tried that with their real money auction house back in 2013 or whenever that game came out and they quickly killed it, but the technology worked. It seems like even if game companies did suddenly decide they wanted to NFTize their in game items due to consumer demand, they would just put them all within their own closed ecosystems, not onto opensea or something like that.

The difference is that NFTs aren't being brought because people want the NFT. They're being bought because people think they can be resold later to someone else for more money. If I commissioned arts purely because I thought I could sell them to someone else later.

Hugh_Jazz_III,"I don't doubt your expertise in contract law. But I would say that your point is arguing a point I never made. I will, again, apologise for any poor communication but this maybe something we are both guilty of. 

I have never said a futures contract could be replaced by an NFT but there is potential (the word 'potential', is indicative that something could work but is yet unproven) that exchange of money could (again note this word 'could') automate an exchange between two parties. Its the same utility that allows for the automation of % of onward sales. This the smart contract component of an NFT.

I totally agree that the economist article using the exchange of the flat in Kyiv is not proof of concept, but again, this is a claim I never made... and neither does the economist. What they have done is used an example to extrapolate a potential (please note the use of this word again) future use case that, whilst unproven, isn't outside the realms of possibility.

&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #NFT Pro Argument (Part 1/2)
&gt; 
&gt; Expanding on [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0oyl/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h6ek70r/).
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them*.
&gt; 
&gt; - **TLDR**: Anyone paying attention this year is aware of NFTs - they have exploded into mainstream consciousness in a way that many of our favorite projects haven't. While some of the crazy valuations indicate a speculative frenzy, as a technology I think NFTs are here to stay because they: (1) are part of a larger interest in developing the '[metaverse](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html)', (2) increase access and velocity of traditionally illiquid markets, and (3) don't just impact the collectibles space but [extend trustless ownership and verification to a variety of other domains
&gt; ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/top-7-nft-use-cases).
&gt; 
&gt; ##NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While much of the attention has centered on NFTs in the ETH ecosystem, there are numerous frameworks for their issuance:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- In addition to the [ERC-721](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/erc-721)/[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standards on ETH, NFTs are also supported by [Tezos](https://www.mclaren.com/racing/partners/tezos/), [Flow](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-flow-dapper-labs), [Zilliqa](https://blog.zilliqa.com/polaris-sports-nets-exclusive-nft-deal-featuring-global-football-giants-in-partnership-with-zilliqa-379b99bcdcbd), [Hedera](https://hedera.com/learning/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft) and [BSC](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/top-reasons-why-bsc-is-the-best-blockchain-for-nfts/) (BEP-721/ BEP-1155) etc., with [planned integration on Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/).
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the Kraken Intelligence NFT report](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ##2021: Year of the NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While NFTs have [been around since 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/), interest picked up in 2017 with the introduction of [CryptoKitties](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/meet-cryptokitties-the-new-digital-beanie-babies-selling-for-100k.html) and [CryptoPunks](https://mashable.com/article/cryptopunks-ethereum-art-collectibles) on the ETH network.
&gt; 
&gt; - However, the public awareness and resulting demand for NFTs in 2021 absolutely dwarf that early excitement:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- The [NFT market tripled in 2020 to $250M](https://nonfungible.com/subscribe/nft-report-2020), only to quickly be eclipsed by [$2B in sales in Q1 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/nft-sales-top-2-billion-in-first-quarter-with-interest-from-newcomers.html). As of Q4 2021, [secondary sales have exceeded $10B](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masonnystrom/issues/the-multichain-nft-market-798081).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High profile sales received widespread media attention (e.g. [Christie's auction of an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html)), while the amount of [established brands entering the market](https://decrypt.co/62411/taco-bell-to-charmin-10-big-brands-jumping-on-nft-bandwagon) continue to increase.
&gt; 
&gt; 		- NFTs have penetrated [sports](https://dappradar.com/flow/collectibles/nba-topshot), [gaming](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-spurring-a-digital-land-grabin-videogame-worlds-11616414401), [music](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-music-industrys-latest-big-hit-11616491801), [cinema](https://variety.com/2021/film/global/nft-movies-first-film-sale-claude-lanzmann-documentary-1234930343/), [clothing](https://thenextweb.com/news/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent), [porn](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/crypto-nft-sex-workers-porn-performers-1142030/), and [academia](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/05/28/uc-berkeley-will-auction-nfts-2-nobel-prize-patents).
&gt; 
&gt;         - Some notable NFTs include: [the dictionary definition for NFT](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thanks-to-merriam-webster-you-can-now-own-the-nft-of-the-definition-of-nft-301288201.html), famous memes [(4)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.html) [(5)](https://blog.originprotocol.com/charlie-bit-my-finger-makes-internet-history-again-1e4a3c54db65), [Reddit avatars](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6ms0b/introducing_cryptosnoosa_very_reddit_take_on_nfts/), [a Picasso painting](https://mashable.com/article/picasso-nft), [a tennis pro's arm](https://decrypt.co/61248/this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft), [Jack Dorsey's first tweet](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-dorsey-nft/twitter-boss-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-sold-for-2-9-million-as-an-nft-idUSKBN2BE2KJ) and [Tim Berners-Lee's source code](https://sothebys-com.brightspotcdn.com/94/a2/742444404b45ae855523a58edcd2/www-pr-en.pdf).
&gt; 
&gt;     - With this increase in public attention also came [debate about the environmental impact of NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change).
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Personally, for the purposes of the Cointest I disregard this narrative as a con argument since it conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains specifically.

CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Zarkorix which won 2nd place in the ALGO Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Disclaimer: ALGO is ~15% of my portfolio.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Solving the Blockchain Trilemma
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is a solution to the ""blockchain trilemma"" - the ability of a network to be simultaneously scalable, secure and decentralised. ALGO's TPS is 1k/s, with a 4s finality, 0.001 ALGO transaction fee and it offers L1 smart contracts - however the network will be upgraded in Q3-Q4 2021 to 45k/s TPS and 2.5s finality, ranking it toward the top for speed and scalability [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/120720-Algorand%202021%20Performance.pdf)
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralisation is achieved by the pure PoS (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which employs **algo**rithmic **rand**omness. Unlike delegated PoS (e.g. XTZ, ADA), PPoS does not employ pooled validators, thus minimizing the drive toward centralisation over time that dPOS suffers from. ALGO node running is permissionless - anybody with &gt;1 ALGO can run a node and theoretically participate in consensus. Moreover, the hardware requirements are extremely low - an ALGO node can be run on a low energy, $50 Raspberry Pi.
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of PPoS is the use of a randomised, weighted lottery that selects validators - known as VRF. This prevents any malicious actor(s) from attacking the network since the identities of the currently selected validators (who must be corrupted in order to carry out an attack) are not known until the block is already finalised. At 1-4k validators, PPoS is paradoxically superior to ETH 2.0's 150,000 nodes - because ETH's beacon chains are long-lived. By contrast, ALGO's random selections vary on both a *round* and *subround* basis - that is, block proposers, voters, vote certifiers all vary, across all steps of certifying a block. Unlike ETH 2.0, which makes a single node the 'king-of-the-hill' for a given round (and thus employs slashing to discourage this node from misbehaving), if a node misbehaves in ALGO, it is simply voted against by all other certifiers - no slashing required.
&gt; 
&gt; Governance (launching 1/10/21) will further decentralise the network by placing decisions concerning the network, tokenomics and which projects receive developer grants (see below) into the hands of ALGO holders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is fast, scalable, secure while remaining decentralised.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Carbon Negative
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand's pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism is extremely lightweight, consuming \~0.000008 kWh/tx (vs. 0.5479 kWh/tx in ADA - that's \~70,000x less energy, and 116250000x less energy than BTC) - with 4,000 active validators. Minting an NFT requires only 0.0000004 kg of CO2 [(Source).](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/sustainable-blockchain-calculating-the-carbon-footprint) This energy usage is 100%+ offset via carbon credits - locked up by an on-chain sustainability oracle, via smart contract, that analyses the energy used by each node. A partnership with ClimateTrade (amongst others) channels this funding into reforestation, peat-management and wind-energy projects at a global level [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/algorand-announcements/carbon_negative_announcement).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is eco-friendly, and the world's first carbon *negative* blockchain network.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Staking Rewards
&gt; 
&gt; ALGO currently offers a seamless staking experience, with an APY of \~5.75% - you simply hold ALGO in a custodial wallet to participate (i.e. you do not need to select a validator and there is no lock-up period). In other words, your ALGO remains liquid at all times. This, however, will be gradually phased out and replaced by Governance, which will increase APY to 7%-30% (depending on the number of participants) but which will require you to vote in every proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Developer Friendly &amp; Ecosystem
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is extremely accessible to developers [(Source 1)](https://developer.algorand.org/tutorials/) [(Source 2)](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/reference/sdks/): it supports development in Python, C++, GO, Java, Javascript and RUST - removing the need for developers to retrain or learn obscure or new languages (e.g. Haskell). ALGO's smart contract language, TEAL, is incredibly intuitive and can be accessed via Python (PyTEAL). As shown in Source 1, Algorand offers comprehensive and detailed documentation and tutorials (for free) to all prospective developers.
&gt; 
&gt; More importantly, \~$200-250m is available to support developers and 50+ grants have already been issued [(Source)](https://algorand.foundation/developers/developer-incentive-awards-program). In total, \~600-650 companies are currently developing on ALGO and intend to deploy DApps/ALGO-based services [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO has the ability to instantly attract developers, and is poised for an explosion in its ecosystem.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Academic Rigor
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand was founded by the Turing-award-winning, MIT professor Silvio Micali - and is backed by an excellent team with solid peer-reviewed academic prowess and publication record [(Source 1)](https://www.algorand.com/technology/research-innovation/research-papers) [(Source 2)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=silvio+micali&amp;btnG=). Silvio Micali conceived of and pioneered zero-knowledge proofs (among many other protocols) - a key, integral part of ETH 2.0 and the future of cryptography/cryptocurrencies. Such a respectable and trustworthy team boosts ALGO's chances of mass adoption, especially in the financial/institutional sectors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO's ability to form partnerships is bolstered by the prestige of its team.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Real World Use
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of Algorand is that it is *forkless* \- it is mathematically impossible for ALGO to fork [(Source)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439751930091X). This is extremely important for real-world usage + transactions. Businesses accepting ALGO (unlike 99% of other cryptos) will not only experience rapid finality but can trust that the transaction is not on a forked, branch of the blockchain that can be lost. This also applies to NFTs. Thus far, ALGO has seen major adoption, recently including:
&gt; 
&gt; * 70M South Americans (potentially 200M soon) using ALGO to issue + store COVID-19 passports [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/vitalpass-vaccine-tracing-latam/)
&gt; * BNext adopting ALGO for its $100b/year Spain&lt;-&gt;Latin American remittance service [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/bnext-announces-next-generation-remittance-service/)
&gt; * MAPay adopting ALGO to power $800m/year in healthcare payments for Bermuda [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/mapay-to-implement-blockchain-based-solutions-on-algorand)
&gt; * SIAE, one of the largest and oldest digital rights managements companies in the world, launched 4.5m NFTs onto ALGO - representing the work of 10,000 artists and which will involve $100m/year in royalties [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases/siae).
&gt; * ALGO was recently featured in a World Economic Forum (WEF) report on cryptocurrency - listed as a recommended ""VIP"" blockchain that solves issues with BTC/ETH and proof-of-stake [(Source)](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Getting_Started_Cryptocurrency_2021.pdf). This document will be seen by institutions, banks and economists worldwide.
&gt; 
&gt; The list goes on and on [Here.](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases)
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is already being deployed for large-scale and institutional solutions - despite only launching \~2y ago.

For government, it's all about control and compliance.

Honestly, this is pretty dumb.

I'm going to be blunt with you.

* Does the ""government"" have access to you current digital currency holdings and spending?

Yes, they just send the bank an official letter saying, ""Give it to us.""

&amp;#x200B;

* Does the ""government"" have access to you National Heath Insurance records?

Yes, they cover the payments and thus, have the records already.

&amp;#x200B;

* Does the ""government"" have access to you all of the information about your passport and driver's license?

Who did you think you registered it with? No duh, they have that information already.

From the article:

Games Are The New Social Platforms
Fortnite exemplifies the massive shift to social gaming. Launched in 2017 as a first-person battle royale game, today Fortnite holds virtual concerts for millions of players and has dedicated spaces in which users can hang out. We estimate that video game content and services will grow at a 15% compound annual growth rate from roughly $200 billion in 2021 to more than $400 billion by 2026 with the rise of ‚Äúvirtual worlds.‚Äù",i3egas7,t3_twbrm5,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/twbrm5/i_read_cathie_woods_ark_invests_132_page_big/i3egas7/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,0,,,
CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by idevcg which won 1st place in the ALGO Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; - Algorand's Smart Contracts uses the AVM rather than the EVM, which is by far more common (the only chain that uses the AVM is Algorand), and therefore there is a lot more support for developers on EVM compatible chains. Furthermore, applications built on top of EVM compatible chains can easily be forked into other EVM compatible chains, while everything has to be built from scratch on Algorand.
&gt; 
&gt; - One huge limitation Algorand currently has (although it is planned that this limitation will be removed in the near future, it has not happened yet) is that each individual wallet address can only create 1000 unique NFTs and 10 smart contracts. This makes it extremely inconvenient for large NFT collections and especially Play To Earn Gaming.
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand's native programming language, TEAL, is a relatively low-level language, which means it is hard to program in and understand for many programmers who are used to high-level programming languages. There were also huge limitations with TEAL3 like not being able to back branch, which significantly limited what developers can do. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Currently, Algorand's DeFi TVL is [not even top 40](https://defillama.com/chains) of L1 and L2 chains. There is only a  single working DEX on Algorand, which went down for 2 weeks early January do to an exploit.
&gt; 
&gt; - Some ASAs (the Algorand equivalent to ERC20 tokens) have Freeze and Clawback, which essentially allows the token creator to freeze people's funds or even take them away at their discretion. This adds a huge layer of risk of bad actors being able to steal funds by taking control of the original ASA address, and is completely antithetical to the whole decentralization aspect of blockchains. Why use a blockchain if you want a centralized actor to control everything like with the banks we have today?
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand lags behind most other L1 chains in terms of Marketing. It is virtually unknown outside of Reddit. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand promised 46,000 TPS by the end of 2021, as well as hinted at announcements of CBDCs also in 2021, neither of which happened.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. Interoperability may be crypto's future - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but as Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)""
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/?context=10000). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20-30 for a token transfer or $60-100 for a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper on this and quantifies how ""[people are entirely ‚Äúlocked out‚Äù of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt;

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. Interoperability may be crypto's future - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but as Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)""
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/?context=10000). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20-30 for a token transfer or $60-100 for a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper on this and quantifies how ""[people are entirely ‚Äúlocked out‚Äù of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt; 
&gt; ##I drink your milkshake
&gt; 
&gt; - Having prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, Ethereum is now [focused on rollups to meet demand](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html).
&gt; 
&gt; -  However, some users may not care about decentralization - they want to participate in DeFi, NFTs, etc. without paying an arm and a leg and will use BSC, SOL or [sidechains that don't inherit ETH's security](https://finematics.com/polygon-commit-chain-explained/).
&gt; 	- [Funds have migrated](https://ethhole.link/) over the past year from ETH [via bridges to L2s and other L1s](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ethereum-bridges-four-months-on-10ee36f889ae).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- [TVL on L2s has boomed](https://l2beat.com/) as users flock to platforms with [cheaper transactions](https://l2fees.info/). Polygon for instance recently [flipped Ethereum in daily active addresses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/polygon-flips-ethereum-on-active-user-addresses/).
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan Selkis of Messari explained these concerns, suggesting that ETH could become cannibalized by competitors and L2s:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;[""Decentralization (specifically political decentralization) and architectural soundness have become secondary properties at best and willfully ignored at worst in the mercenary dominant market of 2021. Not every new chain has tossed decentralization aside, but many have. Even if Ethereum manages to hold off its largest non-EVM rivals, it will leak value to the rollup chains it leans on for scalability. ETH sits at ~60% market cap dominance among Layer 1s.

&gt; - While I agree with many of the points in [this article debunking the ""ETH is centralized"" mantra](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-isnt-decentralized-and-other-myths-ef2d132ee1fe), I think Ethereum still has some progress to make on the [**sociopolitical** and **architectural** aspects of decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274#.355j5eg0v):
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Sociopolitics**:
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Vitalik is a great steward of the project and has been [trying to remove himself as a single point of failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1b_S6Qp2Q&amp;t=656s). Anyone remember the [Vitalik death hoax?](https://fortune.com/2017/06/26/vitalik-death/)
&gt; 
&gt; 			- But as a 'high priest', Vitalik's [vision](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), [proposals](https://news.coincu.com/38718-vitalik-buterin-makes-proposal-eip-4488-to-lower-gas-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-in-the-short-term/) and opinions have preeminent influence and there's no doubt [he remains the 'face' of Ethereum](https://newsprees.com/vitalik-buterin-speaks-to-argentina-decentralization-goes-far-beyond-money/). The community looks to him for key deliverables like [roadmap updates](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402).
&gt; 
&gt;             * While [Ethereum development functions as a true open source project](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-2-0s-latest-strides-forward-13f63652e57d?gi=30830fb85bbd), I think there are a lot of benefits to having a pseudonymous, absent 'leader' like with Bitcoin and Monero. 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- There are also some concerns in my mind about the role of Joe Lubin and ConsenSys in [privatizing what should arguably be public goods](https://saitoofficial.medium.com/the-infura-problem-fe68866484ec). ConsenSys has been a huge player in [driving enterprise adoption](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-acquires-jpm-quorum/) - but they also own [key Ethereum infrastructure like Infura and MetaMask](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation/), which takes us to...
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Architecture**: 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Incidents like [Infura going down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) or the [Geth bug causing a chain split](https://decrypt.co/79597/ethereum-blockchain-splits-software-bug-network) highlight the Ethereum network's reliance on key, dominant infrastructure. Client and hosting diversity thus remains an issue:
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the mainnet (PoW): [~82% of nodes use Geth](https://www.ethernodes.org/), while [~69% of nodes run on hosting services](https://www.ethernodes.org/network-types)([e.g. AWS](https://decrypt.co/44321/70-of-ethereum-nodes-are-hosted-on-centralized-services)).
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the beacon chain (PoS): [64.8% of validators use Prysm](https://twitter.com/sproulM_/status/1451065804183662592).
&gt; 		
&gt;         - [Centralization of infrastructure has been an ongoing concern for the community](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-eth-2-0-could-resolve-the-long-running-centralization-debate-c416b394e54c) and I think clients and consensus infrastructure need to further diversify lest they remain points of failure.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.

&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt;

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

StarBlaze,"The way I see it - and I'll probably get a lot of flak here for it - there's no way to really do anything that's not in some way centralized *except* cryptocurrencies. You can make a pipelined system, but even if you took an imaginary system as such, there would inevitably be a handful of nodes or sectors within such a system that a significant portion of the remaining system and/or subsystems rely on that would inevitably ""centralize"" it anyway.

That's natural progression for a system. Cryptocurrencies aren't really any different - those with more of it have greater influence over its exchange rates - but since the only thing cryptocurrencies do is exist to be exchanged, centralization isn't as much an issue for them. Anything else that has a form or function outside of simple exchange would be more susceptible to the vulnerabilities of centralization. Take Steam for example. If Steam were to go down before offline mode was implemented, then you'd be unable to play your games on the platform while the service was down. Further, if Steam were to shut down permanently without any compensation or means to play those games DRM-free, you'd lose all those games and all the money you spent on them.

I think the closest we'll get to decentralization is NFTs in general. While they'll still be centralized in some form or another, if they're developed to the point that they can be sent cross-chain (i.e. bridged from an ETH-based chain to another blockchain), then even if one chain goes down, the NFTs themselves (which hold the contracts and such) could theoretically be ported to another chain and business would continue as normal with little to no disruption. Thus NFTs would be the decentralized system using centralized subsystems to function, but exist independently of said centralized systems. They still need the centralization to function though, meaning my initial assertion would still be true - the only things that can be truly decentralized are cryptocurrencies, and even those suffer from some form of loose centralization when one or more individuals hold enough of the currency to be able to influence its price significantly.

Maybe I am wrong and I'm just dumb enough to not see past the opaque glass of my own limited intelligence, but those are my thoughts on centralization and the inherent - and unavoidable - dangers of it.",i3bpy0d,t3_tvvn19,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tvvn19/alchemy_a_looming_threat_to_crypto/i3bpy0d/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,0,,,

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**

&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

Kyler_116,"Yeah I do watch Asmon's streams sometimes. I agree with his takes on NFTs. I like the tech, but not when it's with JPG images, it just doesn't make sense to me, it's pointless. All I'll say is that many crypto projects/currencies will have some impactful use cases and the crypto space as a whole does get a bad wrap for being scammy, shady and often viewed as imaginary speculative money. I won't go as far to say that it will replace fiat right now, as that's speculative. There's definitely some scammy tokens out there which doesn't help the image, which makes the barrier to entry kind of intimidating for the broad audience, especially if it's viewed as a cult. Asmon's views on crypto is a very common one and I'm not sure if he's memeing for the content since he's supported crypto in the past.

Let's be realistic, from Asmon's POV, doing his crusade on r/place with this stuff is great content, and it is. It's obvious, I can't blame him for doing that, he's actually very smart. Despite the fact you might think it's messed up, toxic or justified. He might even just have an exaggerated sensationalist streamer character/view facade just for the content and stuff, which is normal. At the end of the day, although many view it as effective advertising, it's just pixels of images...Unironically, just like NFTs. No need to get so hurt by it, it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. But to be fair, his followers doing any he commands at a seconds notice to ""yeet and deleet em"" on r/place is also kind of a cult activity in of itself.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #NFT Pro Argument (Part 1/2)
&gt; 
&gt; Expanding on [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0oyl/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h6ek70r/).
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them*.
&gt; 
&gt; - **TLDR**: Anyone paying attention this year is aware of NFTs - they have exploded into mainstream consciousness in a way that many of our favorite projects haven't. While some of the crazy valuations indicate a speculative frenzy, as a technology I think NFTs are here to stay because they: (1) are part of a larger interest in developing the '[metaverse](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html)', (2) increase access and velocity of traditionally illiquid markets, and (3) don't just impact the collectibles space but [extend trustless ownership and verification to a variety of other domains
&gt; ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/top-7-nft-use-cases).
&gt; 
&gt; ##NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While much of the attention has centered on NFTs in the ETH ecosystem, there are numerous frameworks for their issuance:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- In addition to the [ERC-721](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/erc-721)/[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standards on ETH, NFTs are also supported by [Tezos](https://www.mclaren.com/racing/partners/tezos/), [Flow](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-flow-dapper-labs), [Zilliqa](https://blog.zilliqa.com/polaris-sports-nets-exclusive-nft-deal-featuring-global-football-giants-in-partnership-with-zilliqa-379b99bcdcbd), [Hedera](https://hedera.com/learning/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft) and [BSC](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/top-reasons-why-bsc-is-the-best-blockchain-for-nfts/) (BEP-721/ BEP-1155) etc., with [planned integration on Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/).
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the Kraken Intelligence NFT report](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ##2021: Year of the NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While NFTs have [been around since 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/), interest picked up in 2017 with the introduction of [CryptoKitties](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/meet-cryptokitties-the-new-digital-beanie-babies-selling-for-100k.html) and [CryptoPunks](https://mashable.com/article/cryptopunks-ethereum-art-collectibles) on the ETH network.
&gt; 
&gt; - However, the public awareness and resulting demand for NFTs in 2021 absolutely dwarf that early excitement:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- The [NFT market tripled in 2020 to $250M](https://nonfungible.com/subscribe/nft-report-2020), only to quickly be eclipsed by [$2B in sales in Q1 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/nft-sales-top-2-billion-in-first-quarter-with-interest-from-newcomers.html). As of Q4 2021, [secondary sales have exceeded $10B](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masonnystrom/issues/the-multichain-nft-market-798081).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High profile sales received widespread media attention (e.g. [Christie's auction of an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html)), while the amount of [established brands entering the market](https://decrypt.co/62411/taco-bell-to-charmin-10-big-brands-jumping-on-nft-bandwagon) continue to increase.
&gt; 
&gt; 		- NFTs have penetrated [sports](https://dappradar.com/flow/collectibles/nba-topshot), [gaming](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-spurring-a-digital-land-grabin-videogame-worlds-11616414401), [music](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-music-industrys-latest-big-hit-11616491801), [cinema](https://variety.com/2021/film/global/nft-movies-first-film-sale-claude-lanzmann-documentary-1234930343/), [clothing](https://thenextweb.com/news/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent), [porn](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/crypto-nft-sex-workers-porn-performers-1142030/), and [academia](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/05/28/uc-berkeley-will-auction-nfts-2-nobel-prize-patents).
&gt; 
&gt;         - Some notable NFTs include: [the dictionary definition for NFT](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thanks-to-merriam-webster-you-can-now-own-the-nft-of-the-definition-of-nft-301288201.html), famous memes [(4)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.html) [(5)](https://blog.originprotocol.com/charlie-bit-my-finger-makes-internet-history-again-1e4a3c54db65), [Reddit avatars](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6ms0b/introducing_cryptosnoosa_very_reddit_take_on_nfts/), [a Picasso painting](https://mashable.com/article/picasso-nft), [a tennis pro's arm](https://decrypt.co/61248/this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft), [Jack Dorsey's first tweet](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-dorsey-nft/twitter-boss-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-sold-for-2-9-million-as-an-nft-idUSKBN2BE2KJ) and [Tim Berners-Lee's source code](https://sothebys-com.brightspotcdn.com/94/a2/742444404b45ae855523a58edcd2/www-pr-en.pdf).
&gt; 
&gt;     - With this increase in public attention also came [debate about the environmental impact of NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change).
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Personally, for the purposes of the Cointest I disregard this narrative as a con argument since it conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains specifically.

CointestAdmin,"#ATOM Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Shippior which won 2nd place in the ATOM Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Strictly speaking, [Cosmos](https://v1.cosmos.network/intro) (ticker = ATOM) is a decentralized network of independent parallel Proof-of-Stake blockchains, each powered by BFT consensus algorithms like Tendermint consensus. It is seen as a network of blockchains that can scale and communicate with each other. Together with Polkadot it is seen as one of the first Generation 3 blockchains.
&gt; 
&gt; The Cosmos hub is supposed to be the center of the Cosmos network and it allows the other blockchains that connect to it to use its security. Therefore other chains can focus on things they do best. This has spawned other chains focusing on privacy (Secret Network), NFTs (Stargaze) or memecoins (Chihuahua Chain).
&gt; 
&gt; Cosmos operates through the [IBC] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYuTYykRhH4) (Inter-Blockchain Communication) Protocol. Blockchains that adopt this protocol are easy to link within the network and can then communicate with each other. This allows new blockchains to be easily integrated with the network and be adopted by new users. A good example of this is the rapid growing DEX [Osmosis](app.osmosis.zone). New tokens are integrated rapidly due to being integrated rapidly and the DEX allows people to start getting the tokens quickly after launch, in addition to the many [airdops](www.reddit.com/r/cosmosairdrops) that are currently happening.
&gt; 
&gt; Cosmos has fully functioning on-chain governance. Every proposal has go through voting. In voting a validator votes for all its delegators. A delegator however always has the opportunity to overwrite the vote of their validator by voting on a proposal themselves.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Zarkorix which won 2nd place in the ALGO Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Disclaimer: ALGO is ~15% of my portfolio.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Solving the Blockchain Trilemma
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is a solution to the ""blockchain trilemma"" - the ability of a network to be simultaneously scalable, secure and decentralised. ALGO's TPS is 1k/s, with a 4s finality, 0.001 ALGO transaction fee and it offers L1 smart contracts - however the network will be upgraded in Q3-Q4 2021 to 45k/s TPS and 2.5s finality, ranking it toward the top for speed and scalability [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/120720-Algorand%202021%20Performance.pdf)
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralisation is achieved by the pure PoS (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which employs **algo**rithmic **rand**omness. Unlike delegated PoS (e.g. XTZ, ADA), PPoS does not employ pooled validators, thus minimizing the drive toward centralisation over time that dPOS suffers from. ALGO node running is permissionless - anybody with &gt;1 ALGO can run a node and theoretically participate in consensus. Moreover, the hardware requirements are extremely low - an ALGO node can be run on a low energy, $50 Raspberry Pi.
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of PPoS is the use of a randomised, weighted lottery that selects validators - known as VRF. This prevents any malicious actor(s) from attacking the network since the identities of the currently selected validators (who must be corrupted in order to carry out an attack) are not known until the block is already finalised. At 1-4k validators, PPoS is paradoxically superior to ETH 2.0's 150,000 nodes - because ETH's beacon chains are long-lived. By contrast, ALGO's random selections vary on both a *round* and *subround* basis - that is, block proposers, voters, vote certifiers all vary, across all steps of certifying a block. Unlike ETH 2.0, which makes a single node the 'king-of-the-hill' for a given round (and thus employs slashing to discourage this node from misbehaving), if a node misbehaves in ALGO, it is simply voted against by all other certifiers - no slashing required.
&gt; 
&gt; Governance (launching 1/10/21) will further decentralise the network by placing decisions concerning the network, tokenomics and which projects receive developer grants (see below) into the hands of ALGO holders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is fast, scalable, secure while remaining decentralised.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Carbon Negative
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand's pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism is extremely lightweight, consuming \~0.000008 kWh/tx (vs. 0.5479 kWh/tx in ADA - that's \~70,000x less energy, and 116250000x less energy than BTC) - with 4,000 active validators. Minting an NFT requires only 0.0000004 kg of CO2 [(Source).](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/sustainable-blockchain-calculating-the-carbon-footprint) This energy usage is 100%+ offset via carbon credits - locked up by an on-chain sustainability oracle, via smart contract, that analyses the energy used by each node. A partnership with ClimateTrade (amongst others) channels this funding into reforestation, peat-management and wind-energy projects at a global level [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/algorand-announcements/carbon_negative_announcement).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is eco-friendly, and the world's first carbon *negative* blockchain network.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Staking Rewards
&gt; 
&gt; ALGO currently offers a seamless staking experience, with an APY of \~5.75% - you simply hold ALGO in a custodial wallet to participate (i.e. you do not need to select a validator and there is no lock-up period). In other words, your ALGO remains liquid at all times. This, however, will be gradually phased out and replaced by Governance, which will increase APY to 7%-30% (depending on the number of participants) but which will require you to vote in every proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Developer Friendly &amp; Ecosystem
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is extremely accessible to developers [(Source 1)](https://developer.algorand.org/tutorials/) [(Source 2)](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/reference/sdks/): it supports development in Python, C++, GO, Java, Javascript and RUST - removing the need for developers to retrain or learn obscure or new languages (e.g. Haskell). ALGO's smart contract language, TEAL, is incredibly intuitive and can be accessed via Python (PyTEAL). As shown in Source 1, Algorand offers comprehensive and detailed documentation and tutorials (for free) to all prospective developers.
&gt; 
&gt; More importantly, \~$200-250m is available to support developers and 50+ grants have already been issued [(Source)](https://algorand.foundation/developers/developer-incentive-awards-program). In total, \~600-650 companies are currently developing on ALGO and intend to deploy DApps/ALGO-based services [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO has the ability to instantly attract developers, and is poised for an explosion in its ecosystem.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Academic Rigor
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand was founded by the Turing-award-winning, MIT professor Silvio Micali - and is backed by an excellent team with solid peer-reviewed academic prowess and publication record [(Source 1)](https://www.algorand.com/technology/research-innovation/research-papers) [(Source 2)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=silvio+micali&amp;btnG=). Silvio Micali conceived of and pioneered zero-knowledge proofs (among many other protocols) - a key, integral part of ETH 2.0 and the future of cryptography/cryptocurrencies. Such a respectable and trustworthy team boosts ALGO's chances of mass adoption, especially in the financial/institutional sectors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO's ability to form partnerships is bolstered by the prestige of its team.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Real World Use
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of Algorand is that it is *forkless* \- it is mathematically impossible for ALGO to fork [(Source)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439751930091X). This is extremely important for real-world usage + transactions. Businesses accepting ALGO (unlike 99% of other cryptos) will not only experience rapid finality but can trust that the transaction is not on a forked, branch of the blockchain that can be lost. This also applies to NFTs. Thus far, ALGO has seen major adoption, recently including:
&gt; 
&gt; * 70M South Americans (potentially 200M soon) using ALGO to issue + store COVID-19 passports [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/vitalpass-vaccine-tracing-latam/)
&gt; * BNext adopting ALGO for its $100b/year Spain&lt;-&gt;Latin American remittance service [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/bnext-announces-next-generation-remittance-service/)
&gt; * MAPay adopting ALGO to power $800m/year in healthcare payments for Bermuda [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/mapay-to-implement-blockchain-based-solutions-on-algorand)
&gt; * SIAE, one of the largest and oldest digital rights managements companies in the world, launched 4.5m NFTs onto ALGO - representing the work of 10,000 artists and which will involve $100m/year in royalties [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases/siae).
&gt; * ALGO was recently featured in a World Economic Forum (WEF) report on cryptocurrency - listed as a recommended ""VIP"" blockchain that solves issues with BTC/ETH and proof-of-stake [(Source)](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Getting_Started_Cryptocurrency_2021.pdf). This document will be seen by institutions, banks and economists worldwide.
&gt; 
&gt; The list goes on and on [Here.](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases)
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is already being deployed for large-scale and institutional solutions - despite only launching \~2y ago.

CointestAdmin,"#Litecoin Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by FrogsDoBeCool which won 2nd place in the Litecoin Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; # Litecoin - A Cryptocurrency With Currency in Mind
&gt; 
&gt; Disclosure: I have never owned Litecoin, I do not personally believe it is a profitable investment compared to other cryptos, but is a safe crypto to bet on. I have made a Cointest on this topic previously, which has been copied pasted here. This submission is supposed to be readable for any one person just starting in crypto, but does delve into more technicals later on.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; # The Start of Litecoin
&gt; 
&gt; * **Charlie Lee,** the [founder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Lee_(computer_scientist)#cite_note-Williams-Grut_2018-1) and developer of Litecoin. Lee begun his life at Ivory coast, his family being Chinese immigrants at the time. During his teens, he moved to the United States where he finished [Highschool](https://www.cusd20.com/o/lhs) and [College.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) His major being in Computer Science, and eventually his master's being in Computer science as well.
&gt;    * After College, Charlie had begun working [on getting hired](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chocobo/), from 2000 to 2007 he worked at a couple of small technology companies, but in September of 2007 he was able to be hired at Google! He has helped build several key features of Chrome until 2013.
&gt;    * In 2011, Charlie learned of bitcoin via the [silk road](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/silk-road.asp), due to his already skeptical nature of the government he instantly was fond of bitcoin, he began mining bitcoin in 2011 but soon realized the faults bitcoin had, and began building what is now called Litecoin.
&gt; * **Litecoin's Foundations**
&gt;    * Litecoin was built in C++ and officially was a fork of Bitcoin. All Operating systems allow for Litecoin to be used and developed on except some minor operating systems, and a couple of major ones like - chrome os, mac os.
&gt;    * Litecoin works similar in bitcoin in that every 4\~ years the reward for mining is [halved](https://stormgain.com/blog/litecoin-ltc-halving#:~:text=more%20acceptable%20values.-,When%20is%20the%20next%20Litecoin%20halving%3F,will%20drop%20to%206.25%20LTC). The next being in 2023.
&gt;    * Litecoin was built to act as cash, since every transaction cost (currently) around [$0.02.](https://bitinfocharts.com/litecoin/) Litecoin has a block time of 2.5 minutes, meaning every 2.5 minutes a transaction block is verified, leaving quicker transactions and less bloat in the network. The only time 2.5 minutes per block was overextended was in [2012](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/litecoin-confirmationtime.html#3y) when Litecoin during Litecoin's early release.
&gt;       * Litecoin has about 50 transactions per second, about ten times better than bitcoin.
&gt;    * The richest litecoin wallet owns about 6.5% of all litecoin's. From what I could find (not a lot) this may be an exchange's cold wallet. They dca into litecoin a lot, but buy at pretty bad times, nearly doubling its LTC held just days before the may crash.
&gt;    * [Open Source](https://github.com/litecoin-project/litecoin)
&gt;       * Litecoin is fully decentralized in the fact any one person could submit code into the network and as long as a majority of miners agree to that fork it will be implimented. This is similar to bitcoin.
&gt;    * Litecoin made its own satoshi esque vocabulary, a photon.
&gt;    * The Hashing Algorithm
&gt;       * Since Litecoin works on Proof of Work, it needed to find a solution to ASICS, a crypto mining specific cpu. Litecoin solves this with [scrypt](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/litecoin-scrypt-algorithm-explained/#:~:text=Scrypt%20is%20a%20hash%20function,Litecoin%20and%20Bitcoin%20protocols%20respectively). What's funny is apparently since Dogecoin is a fork of Litecoin anyone can mine both Litecoin and Dogecoin simultaneously on the same network.
&gt;       * There was no pre-mine on Litecoin. The first people who mined got the most. The supply of Litecoin is about 84 million at maximum.
&gt;    * The price of Litecoin just barely went over its [2017](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/litecoin/) peak, which to many sounds bad, although 80-90% of all cryptocurrencies failed during the 2018 bear run, so litecoin has still beat the majority of the market.
&gt; 
&gt; # What Litecoin is Now
&gt; 
&gt; * **Litecoin was the first major cryptocurrency to implement the lightning network.**
&gt;    * The Lightning network
&gt;       * The lightning network is a layer two solution to build scalability, security, and speed upon bitcoin, but in this case, [Litecoin.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network#:~:text=On%20May%2010%2C%202017%2C%20Christian,a%20fraction%20of%20a%20second)
&gt;       * Taken from my ""Lightning network pro july - aug 2021""... ""The lightning network to work basically sets up a channel that connects the network from the sender and receiver. The lightning networks uses multi-signature transactions to confirm a lightning channel. Time locks are also used, which is a way to stop transactions from instantly being executed. Time locks are most commonly used when there‚Äôs a lot of demand for bitcoin transactions, and not enough blocks being confirmed.""
&gt;       * TLDR: Lightning network will may litecoin even faster, secure, and decentralized than ever.
&gt;    * **Mimble Wimble**
&gt;       * Mimble Wimble is the update to Litecoin, it is THE update to litecoin to include complete privacy, comparable to Zcash and Monero, but with scalability and [security](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-mimblewimble). Mimble wimble was first thought of in 2016, but took 4 years to begin testing on the litecoin test-net.
&gt;       * mimble wimble hides the amount of litecoin sent, the address, and even the ip of the user sending the litecoin, thanks to [Dandelion.](https://medium.com/beam-mw/about-dandelion-and-mimblewimble-e083597e0355)
&gt;       * To explain further, Litecoin Mimble wimble has no addresses. transactions and private keys are verified no longer by signing, but ""Proof of ownership is instead achieved through methods similar to CoinJoin and Confidential Transactions. Input and output owners form a multi-signature to sign off on each block, eliminating the need for addresses,"" [source](https://medium.com/interdax/litecoins-mimblewimble-extension-block-proposal-209337b38b11)
&gt;    * **OmniLite**
&gt;       * OmniLite for the litecoin network adds support for smart contracts, easily created crypto currencies, and nfts. Meaning as of September, Litecoin while using Omnilite, [supports smart contracts and nfts.](https://litecoin-foundation.org/omnilite-launches-for-the-litecoin-network/)
&gt;       * Omnilite was mainly developed by a worker and programmer of the litecoin foundation, Loshan T.
&gt; 
&gt; # Conclusion
&gt; 
&gt; * Litecoin's past and trajectory as one of the most popular cryptocurrencies continues with the development that the litecoin foundation puts into Litecoin to this day. 
&gt; * The ability to include smart contracts, cheap transactions, scalability, and security helps solve the [cryptocurrency trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition#:~:text=The%20blockchain%20trilemma%20refers%20to,decentralization%2C%20security%2C%20and%20scalability), the first cryptocurrency to perfect the trilemma will become one of the most invested, used, and popular, Litecoin is close.

iamjide91,"Am not an economist either but I know one thing, no investment, zero chance of having a fruitful financial future.

Things will not get better, that's a fact.

I have picked cryptocurrencies as a hedge against inflation because it's one of the easiest to access and one with maximum potential while having to risk a little to nothing at all I'm some cases if you know what you are doing. Thanks to the many assets and products (dapps) in the space as we speak.

Providing liquidity using [Tetu](http://app.tetu.io) and [Thorswap ](http://app.thorswap.finance) has been my savior. Especially using stablecoins. Yields from that is then invested into high volatility assets while keeping my base investment intact as I also continue to take profits from those to push up my stable coin investment.

I have also found staking NFTs like [DIA](http://diadata.org/arts) genesis NFTs credible as it presents me opportunity to earn yeilds of up to 2000% annually. And it's native token, in which I get the yields is also one of top data oracle projects, fairly undervalued, with potentials to grow. So I have no problem holding this long term either.

Again. The Blockchain has also present gaming fanatics opportunities to earn while doing what they know best, gaming. And you don't even have to be a fanatic or an addict, these games are easy, anyone can play them. Games like [Crypto Royale ](http://cryptoroyale.one) or [Mecha Morphing ](http://mechamorphing.com) makes this list IMO.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. Interoperability may be crypto's future - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but as Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)""
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/?context=10000). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20-30 for a token transfer or $60-100 for a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper on this and quantifies how ""[people are entirely ‚Äúlocked out‚Äù of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt; 
&gt; ##I drink your milkshake
&gt; 
&gt; - Having prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, Ethereum is now [focused on rollups to meet demand](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html).
&gt; 
&gt; -  However, some users may not care about decentralization - they want to participate in DeFi, NFTs, etc. without paying an arm and a leg and will use BSC, SOL or [sidechains that don't inherit ETH's security](https://finematics.com/polygon-commit-chain-explained/).
&gt; 	- [Funds have migrated](https://ethhole.link/) over the past year from ETH [via bridges to L2s and other L1s](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ethereum-bridges-four-months-on-10ee36f889ae).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- [TVL on L2s has boomed](https://l2beat.com/) as users flock to platforms with [cheaper transactions](https://l2fees.info/). Polygon for instance recently [flipped Ethereum in daily active addresses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/polygon-flips-ethereum-on-active-user-addresses/).
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan Selkis of Messari explained these concerns, suggesting that ETH could become cannibalized by competitors and L2s:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;[""Decentralization (specifically political decentralization) and architectural soundness have become secondary properties at best and willfully ignored at worst in the mercenary dominant market of 2021. Not every new chain has tossed decentralization aside, but many have. Even if Ethereum manages to hold off its largest non-EVM rivals, it will leak value to the rollup chains it leans on for scalability. ETH sits at ~60% market cap dominance among Layer 1s. That will either fall below 50% in 2022, or its Layer 2 rollup tokens will eat into its growth. Maybe both.] (https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf)""
&gt; 
&gt; ##Points of failure?
&gt; 
&gt; - While I agree with many of the points in [this article debunking the ""ETH is centralized"" mantra](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-isnt-decentralized-and-other-myths-ef2d132ee1fe), I think Ethereum still has some progress to make on the [**sociopolitical** and **architectural** aspects of decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274#.355j5eg0v):
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Sociopolitics**:
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Vitalik is a great steward of the project and has been [trying to remove himself as a single point of failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1b_S6Qp2Q&amp;t=656s). Anyone remember the [Vitalik death hoax?](https://fortune.com/2017/06/26/vitalik-death/)
&gt; 
&gt; 			- But as a 'high priest', Vitalik's [vision](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), [proposals](https://news.coincu.com/38718-vitalik-buterin-makes-proposal-eip-4488-to-lower-gas-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-in-the-short-term/) and opinions have preeminent influence and there's no doubt [he remains the 'face' of Ethereum](https://newsprees.com/vitalik-buterin-speaks-to-argentina-decentralization-goes-far-beyond-money/). The community looks to him for key deliverables like [roadmap updates](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402).
&gt; 
&gt;             * While [Ethereum development functions as a true open source project](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-2-0s-latest-strides-forward-13f63652e57d?gi=30830fb85bbd), I think there are a lot of benefits to having a pseudonymous, absent 'leader' like with Bitcoin and Monero. 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- There are also some concerns in my mind about the role of Joe Lubin and ConsenSys in [privatizing what should arguably be public goods](https://saitoofficial.medium.com/the-infura-problem-fe68866484ec). ConsenSys has been a huge player in [driving enterprise adoption](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-acquires-jpm-quorum/) - but they also own [key Ethereum infrastructure like Infura and MetaMask](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation/), which takes us to...
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Architecture**: 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Incidents like [Infura going down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) or the [Geth bug causing a chain split](https://decrypt.co/79597/ethereum-blockchain-splits-software-bug-network) highlight the Ethereum network's reliance on key, dominant infrastructure. Client and hosting diversity thus remains an issue:
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the mainnet (PoW): [~82% of nodes use Geth](https://www.ethernodes.org/), while [~69% of nodes run on hosting services](https://www.ethernodes.org/network-types)([e.g. AWS](https://decrypt.co/44321/70-of-ethereum-nodes-are-hosted-on-centralized-services)).
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the beacon chain (PoS): [64.8% of validators use Prysm](https://twitter.com/sproulM_/status/1451065804183662592).
&gt; 		
&gt;         - [Centralization of infrastructure has been an ongoing concern for the community](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-eth-2-0-could-resolve-the-long-running-centralization-debate-c416b394e54c) and I think clients and consensus infrastructure need to further diversify lest they remain points of failure.

btc_clueless,"#1 Understand how to keep your seed phrase absolutely safe (no photos, no digital storage, especially not on a phone or cloud)

#2 Don't try to take shortcuts or outsmart the market because you feel you are late to the party and want to get rich quick. Buy and hodl major coins like BTC and ETH over years is by far the safest bet to make profits, although slow and boring.

#3 Learn about risk management. Don't put all your eggs in one basket (""going all in""), especially if the name of this basket is brand new and the hype-or-the-month type of coin. Long established coins that did consistently well over years are way safer than any newer altcoin. Buy and hodl is safer than day or swing trading. Don't touch leverage or invest more than you can afford to lose.

#4 Never bet your whole portfolio on any trade. Keep a separate hodl wallet that holds most of your coins and don't touch those. And then have a much smaller wallet (maybe 10-15%) for dabbling and trying to be smarter than the market. Never mix those two.

#5 Ignore short- term ups and downs but try to get a grasp on the larger movements of the markets. These are way easier to understand and trade. Also watch closely how the narrative changes every couple of months (DeFi summer, NFTs, Web3/Metaverse). Most price action of newer projects is built on hype and it's a game of hot potato as the narrative shifts quickly from one topic to the next.

#6 Never get emotionally attached to your coins. Joining altcoin subs (XRP army, Link marines, etc...) may make it seem like you are a community holding together, all in the same boat. No! Remove all emotion from your trades. when you feel anger, FOMO or anything like that, step away and clear your head before deciding if you should hold, sell or buy more.Ask yourself: with everything I learned throughout my crypto journey, if I would put together a fresh new portfolio today, would I still pick the same coins at the same percentage as they are in my actual current portfolio? If the answer is ""no"" then you got to attached to some of your bags and should re-balance your portfolio. Also, don't let pride get in your way (""I made this choice and I will ride this coin to the bottom if it has to be..."")

#7 If you have any serious money invested (&gt; $1000 or so) get a hardware wallet from a trusted manufacturer (Ledger or Trezor, no new shit from people who have no experience with cryptography). Hardware wallets are way safer than any software wallet on your computer or phone.

#8 Use 2FA religiously for anything possible. Even better, get a Yubikey (or two) so you need a physical device to approve of your withdrawals from exchanges etc.

#9 When using MetaMask don't sign ""ok"" on random smart contracts from websites you don't 100% trust and verified. Even using a hardware wallet with MetaMask won't save you if you unintentionally approved a smart contract that will rob your wallet.

#10 Never fuck with the tax man. They might be a bit behind right now with all the new crypto stuff but every transaction is recorded on the blockchain forever and if you ever used centralized exchanges, the tax authorities will eventually get to know you bought crypto and if you didn't report it, they will hunt you down. Keep a record or every single transaction you  do (yes, it's very painful to properly record all that without gaps, especially with DeFi).

Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by idevcg which won 1st place in the ALGO Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; - Algorand's Smart Contracts uses the AVM rather than the EVM, which is by far more common (the only chain that uses the AVM is Algorand), and therefore there is a lot more support for developers on EVM compatible chains. Furthermore, applications built on top of EVM compatible chains can easily be forked into other EVM compatible chains, while everything has to be built from scratch on Algorand.
&gt; 
&gt; - One huge limitation Algorand currently has (although it is planned that this limitation will be removed in the near future, it has not happened yet) is that each individual wallet address can only create 1000 unique NFTs and 10 smart contracts. This makes it extremely inconvenient for large NFT collections and especially Play To Earn Gaming.
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand's native programming language, TEAL, is a relatively low-level language, which means it is hard to program in and understand for many programmers who are used to high-level programming languages. There were also huge limitations with TEAL3 like not being able to back branch, which significantly limited what developers can do. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Currently, Algorand's DeFi TVL is [not even top 40](https://defillama.com/chains) of L1 and L2 chains. There is only a  single working DEX on Algorand, which went down for 2 weeks early January do to an exploit.
&gt; 
&gt; - Some ASAs (the Algorand equivalent to ERC20 tokens) have Freeze and Clawback, which essentially allows the token creator to freeze people's funds or even take them away at their discretion. This adds a huge layer of risk of bad actors being able to steal funds by taking control of the original ASA address, and is completely antithetical to the whole decentralization aspect of blockchains. Why use a blockchain if you want a centralized actor to control everything like with the banks we have today?
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand lags behind most other L1 chains in terms of Marketing. It is virtually unknown outside of Reddit. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand promised 46,000 TPS by the end of 2021, as well as hinted at announcements of CBDCs also in 2021, neither of which happened.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. Interoperability may be crypto's future - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but as Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)""
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/?context=10000). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20-30 for a token transfer or $60-100 for a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper on this and quantifies how ""[people are entirely ‚Äúlocked out‚Äù of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt; 
&gt; ##I drink your milkshake
&gt; 
&gt; - Having prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, Ethereum is now [focused on rollups to meet demand](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html).
&gt; 
&gt; -  However, some users may not care about decentralization - they want to participate in DeFi, NFTs, etc. without paying an arm and a leg and will use BSC, SOL or [sidechains that don't inherit ETH's security](https://finematics.com/polygon-commit-chain-explained/).
&gt; 	- [Funds have migrated](https://ethhole.link/) over the past year from ETH [via bridges to L2s and other L1s](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ethereum-bridges-four-months-on-10ee36f889ae).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- [TVL on L2s has boomed](https://l2beat.com/) as users flock to platforms with [cheaper transactions](https://l2fees.info/). Polygon for instance recently [flipped Ethereum in daily active addresses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/polygon-flips-ethereum-on-active-user-addresses/).
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan Selkis of Messari explained these concerns, suggesting that ETH could become cannibalized by competitors and L2s:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;[""Decentralization (specifically political decentralization) and architectural soundness have become secondary properties at best and willfully ignored at worst in the mercenary dominant market of 2021. Not every new chain has tossed decentralization aside, but many have. Even if Ethereum manages to hold off its largest non-EVM rivals, it will leak value to the rollup chains it leans on for scalability. ETH sits at ~60% market cap dominance among Layer 1s. That will either fall below 50% in 2022, or its Layer 2 rollup tokens will eat into its growth. Maybe both.] (https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf)""
&gt; 
&gt; ##Points of failure?
&gt; 
&gt; - While I agree with many of the points in [this article debunking the ""ETH is centralized"" mantra](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-isnt-decentralized-and-other-myths-ef2d132ee1fe), I think Ethereum still has some progress to make on the [**sociopolitical** and **architectural** aspects of decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274#.355j5eg0v):
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Sociopolitics**:
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Vitalik is a great steward of the project and has been [trying to remove himself as a single point of failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1b_S6Qp2Q&amp;t=656s). Anyone remember the [Vitalik death hoax?](https://fortune.com/2017/06/26/vitalik-death/)
&gt; 
&gt; 			- But as a 'high priest', Vitalik's [vision](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), [proposals](https://news.coincu.com/38718-vitalik-buterin-makes-proposal-eip-4488-to-lower-gas-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-in-the-short-term/) and opinions have preeminent influence and there's no doubt [he remains the 'face' of Ethereum](https://newsprees.com/vitalik-buterin-speaks-to-argentina-decentralization-goes-far-beyond-money/). The community looks to him for key deliverables like [roadmap updates](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402).
&gt; 
&gt;             * While [Ethereum development functions as a true open source project](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-2-0s-latest-strides-forward-13f63652e57d?gi=30830fb85bbd), I think there are a lot of benefits to having a pseudonymous, absent 'leader' like with Bitcoin and Monero. 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- There are also some concerns in my mind about the role of Joe Lubin and ConsenSys in [privatizing what should arguably be public goods](https://saitoofficial.medium.com/the-infura-problem-fe68866484ec). ConsenSys has been a huge player in [driving enterprise adoption](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-acquires-jpm-quorum/) - but they also own [key Ethereum infrastructure like Infura and MetaMask](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation/), which takes us to...
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Architecture**: 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Incidents like [Infura going down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) or the [Geth bug causing a chain split](https://decrypt.co/79597/ethereum-blockchain-splits-software-bug-network) highlight the Ethereum network's reliance on key, dominant infrastructure. Client and hosting diversity thus remains an issue:
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the mainnet (PoW): [~82% of nodes use Geth](https://www.ethernodes.org/), while [~69% of nodes run on hosting services](https://www.ethernodes.org/network-types)([e.g. AWS](https://decrypt.co/44321/70-of-ethereum-nodes-are-hosted-on-centralized-services)).
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the beacon chain (PoS): [64.8% of validators use Prysm](https://twitter.com/sproulM_/status/1451065804183662592).
&gt; 		
&gt;         - [Centralization of infrastructure has been an ongoing concern for the community](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-eth-2-0-could-resolve-the-long-running-centralization-debate-c416b394e54c) and I think clients and consensus infrastructure need to further diversify lest they remain points of failure.

Below is an argument written by Zarkorix which won 2nd place in the ALGO Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Disclaimer: ALGO is ~15% of my portfolio.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Solving the Blockchain Trilemma
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is a solution to the ""blockchain trilemma"" - the ability of a network to be simultaneously scalable, secure and decentralised. ALGO's TPS is 1k/s, with a 4s finality, 0.001 ALGO transaction fee and it offers L1 smart contracts - however the network will be upgraded in Q3-Q4 2021 to 45k/s TPS and 2.5s finality, ranking it toward the top for speed and scalability [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/120720-Algorand%202021%20Performance.pdf)
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralisation is achieved by the pure PoS (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which employs **algo**rithmic **rand**omness. Unlike delegated PoS (e.g. XTZ, ADA), PPoS does not employ pooled validators, thus minimizing the drive toward centralisation over time that dPOS suffers from. ALGO node running is permissionless - anybody with &gt;1 ALGO can run a node and theoretically participate in consensus. Moreover, the hardware requirements are extremely low - an ALGO node can be run on a low energy, $50 Raspberry Pi.
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of PPoS is the use of a randomised, weighted lottery that selects validators - known as VRF. This prevents any malicious actor(s) from attacking the network since the identities of the currently selected validators (who must be corrupted in order to carry out an attack) are not known until the block is already finalised. At 1-4k validators, PPoS is paradoxically superior to ETH 2.0's 150,000 nodes - because ETH's beacon chains are long-lived. By contrast, ALGO's random selections vary on both a *round* and *subround* basis - that is, block proposers, voters, vote certifiers all vary, across all steps of certifying a block. Unlike ETH 2.0, which makes a single node the 'king-of-the-hill' for a given round (and thus employs slashing to discourage this node from misbehaving), if a node misbehaves in ALGO, it is simply voted against by all other certifiers - no slashing required.
&gt; 
&gt; Governance (launching 1/10/21) will further decentralise the network by placing decisions concerning the network, tokenomics and which projects receive developer grants (see below) into the hands of ALGO holders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is fast, scalable, secure while remaining decentralised.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Carbon Negative
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand's pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism is extremely lightweight, consuming \~0.000008 kWh/tx (vs. 0.5479 kWh/tx in ADA - that's \~70,000x less energy, and 116250000x less energy than BTC) - with 4,000 active validators. Minting an NFT requires only 0.0000004 kg of CO2 [(Source).](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/sustainable-blockchain-calculating-the-carbon-footprint) This energy usage is 100%+ offset via carbon credits - locked up by an on-chain sustainability oracle, via smart contract, that analyses the energy used by each node. A partnership with ClimateTrade (amongst others) channels this funding into reforestation, peat-management and wind-energy projects at a global level [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/algorand-announcements/carbon_negative_announcement).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is eco-friendly, and the world's first carbon *negative* blockchain network.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Staking Rewards
&gt; 
&gt; ALGO currently offers a seamless staking experience, with an APY of \~5.75% - you simply hold ALGO in a custodial wallet to participate (i.e. you do not need to select a validator and there is no lock-up period). In other words, your ALGO remains liquid at all times. This, however, will be gradually phased out and replaced by Governance, which will increase APY to 7%-30% (depending on the number of participants) but which will require you to vote in every proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Developer Friendly &amp; Ecosystem
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is extremely accessible to developers [(Source 1)](https://developer.algorand.org/tutorials/) [(Source 2)](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/reference/sdks/): it supports development in Python, C++, GO, Java, Javascript and RUST - removing the need for developers to retrain or learn obscure or new languages (e.g. Haskell). ALGO's smart contract language, TEAL, is incredibly intuitive and can be accessed via Python (PyTEAL). As shown in Source 1, Algorand offers comprehensive and detailed documentation and tutorials (for free) to all prospective developers.
&gt; 
&gt; More importantly, \~$200-250m is available to support developers and 50+ grants have already been issued [(Source)](https://algorand.foundation/developers/developer-incentive-awards-program). In total, \~600-650 companies are currently developing on ALGO and intend to deploy DApps/ALGO-based services [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO has the ability to instantly attract developers, and is poised for an explosion in its ecosystem.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Academic Rigor
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand was founded by the Turing-award-winning, MIT professor Silvio Micali - and is backed by an excellent team with solid peer-reviewed academic prowess and publication record [(Source 1)](https://www.algorand.com/technology/research-innovation/research-papers) [(Source 2)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=silvio+micali&amp;btnG=). Silvio Micali conceived of and pioneered zero-knowledge proofs (among many other protocols) - a key, integral part of ETH 2.0 and the future of cryptography/cryptocurrencies. Such a respectable and trustworthy team boosts ALGO's chances of mass adoption, especially in the financial/institutional sectors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO's ability to form partnerships is bolstered by the prestige of its team.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Real World Use
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of Algorand is that it is *forkless* \- it is mathematically impossible for ALGO to fork [(Source)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439751930091X). This is extremely important for real-world usage + transactions. Businesses accepting ALGO (unlike 99% of other cryptos) will not only experience rapid finality but can trust that the transaction is not on a forked, branch of the blockchain that can be lost. This also applies to NFTs. Thus far, ALGO has seen major adoption, recently including:
&gt; 
&gt; * 70M South Americans (potentially 200M soon) using ALGO to issue + store COVID-19 passports [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/vitalpass-vaccine-tracing-latam/)
&gt; * BNext adopting ALGO for its $100b/year Spain&lt;-&gt;Latin American remittance service [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/bnext-announces-next-generation-remittance-service/)
&gt; * MAPay adopting ALGO to power $800m/year in healthcare payments for Bermuda [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/mapay-to-implement-blockchain-based-solutions-on-algorand)
&gt; * SIAE, one of the largest and oldest digital rights managements companies in the world, launched 4.5m NFTs onto ALGO - representing the work of 10,000 artists and which will involve $100m/year in royalties [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases/siae).
&gt; * ALGO was recently featured in a World Economic Forum (WEF) report on cryptocurrency - listed as a recommended ""VIP"" blockchain that solves issues with BTC/ETH and proof-of-stake [(Source)](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Getting_Started_Cryptocurrency_2021.pdf). This document will be seen by institutions, banks and economists worldwide.
&gt; 
&gt; The list goes on and on [Here.](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases)
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is already being deployed for large-scale and institutional solutions - despite only launching \~2y ago.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

GameWorldShaper,"&gt; This is not how indie game development works. You build a working prototype and THEN you ask for funds to hire artists.

What you meant to say is that it is how you wish indie games worked, as there are multiple indie games like Stardew where the costs was carried by a third party.

With that said I am not opposed to making a proof of concept, or a porotype. It is just that these are not playable versions of the game. They are additions.  

As long as it is not expected for me to have a demo or an early build of the game yet.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You code, you make some barebones placeholder art

I am an artist, there is no concerns related to art for the project. It is the one side I can guarantee gets done no matter what.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Bullshit. The indie game market is huge. Most of these games started out being developed by just one person in their free time. 

Just because there are many small games doesn't mean there is a market for them. There is a GDC talk with the statistics, and multiple news sites cover it each year. Over 80% of the games on the app store where published by studios that shut down only a few months after publishing. The game isn't removed when the studio is shut down.

The huge indie market that you are talking about, the big indies, are just slightly above 4% of all indie games. What you are observing is survival bias, with most indie games not reaching the $250 line.

&amp;#x200B;

Interesting enough is that while all of these big indies did start with some kind of playable version, most of them had some kind of significant circumstance leading to that point. Some where modders as kids, others received help from family, a few got help from their schools and teachers, government funding.

Since the only thing I have is my artistic skill, it is what I have to work with. NFTs is a possible path for me.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Your project is way beyond the scope of what an indie game should be then.

I worked in depth on a Indie mobile game that took only a year, I plan on following the same structure. Of course I am aware it will take me longer, but in one year I will have something substantial; not necessarily my target but something.

&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

I plan on selling the first 250 NFTs at $96 each. That means I can only make $24000 max because that is 3X of my goal, to allow 3 years of development if I can, with $8000 being my minimum 1 year of development.

If you have absolutely nothing to show yet this is greedy beyond compare. This is not how indie game development works. You build a working prototype and THEN you ask for funds to hire artists.

A working prototype of a game can be produced by a single person in their free time next to a 40 hour job. You're trying to make sorrow excuses here for getting funded way before you should be funded.

&gt;understand what you are saying, but it is a catch 22. I need money to make a game, but I need a game to make money.

You don't need money to make a game. A working prototype build doesn't cost anything. You code, you make some barebones placeholder art, you put it up for public testing. You improve the concept based on feedback, build another prototype and THEN you start actually working in the stuff that does cost money to create.

&gt;There is no market for small term projects.

Bullshit. The indie game market is huge. Most of these games started out being developed by just one person in their free time. Some of the most successful indie games never even went beyond just one person working on it in their free time UNTIL they became successful and could enlarge scope.

&gt;Working with my free time alone I am only getting 2 hours a day now, that is 1/4 of what I need a day. Meaning a 1 year game would take 4 years at this rate, with no hope of ever adding multiplayer.

Your project is way beyond the scope of what an indie game should be then. You seem to lack a lot of experience of game development if you truly believe that creating a good game takes one year working full time minimum.

And asking for funds that big before showing a portfolio of finished games is asking for failure. Or just a plain old scam.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:

&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

GameWorldShaper,"I have no intent of bailing, I am an artist, a creator. The money is not what interests me it is making games that I want to do. If I had the money, I would spend it on making games and other projects.

Of course I have seen enough of these projects to know that even people with good intentions are turned sour by money. That is why it will have fixed price .

I plan on selling the first 250 NFTs at $96 each. That means I can only make $24000 max because that is 3X of my goal, to allow 3 years of development if I can, with $8000 being my minimum 1 year of development.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;This is why I also urge everyone to not buy NFTs for games where the game isn't even playable yet.

I understand what you are saying, but it is a catch 22. I need money to make a game, but I need a game to make money.

Selling small games doesn't work, when they say most indies don't make even $250 it is not a lie. The hyper casual game I helped make didn't even get $50. There is no market for small term projects.

I work as an artist, I don't have the credit score to get a loan.

Working with my free time alone I am only getting 2 hours a day now, that is 1/4 of what I need a day. Meaning a 1 year game would take 4 years at this rate, with no hope of ever adding multiplayer.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. Interoperability may be crypto's future - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but as Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)""
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/?context=10000). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20-30 for a token transfer or $60-100 for a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper on this and quantifies how ""[people are entirely ‚Äúlocked out‚Äù of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt; 
&gt; ##I drink your milkshake
&gt; 
&gt; - Having prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, Ethereum is now [focused on rollups to meet demand](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html).
&gt; 
&gt; -  However, some users may not care about decentralization - they want to participate in DeFi, NFTs, etc. without paying an arm and a leg and will use BSC, SOL or [sidechains that don't inherit ETH's security](https://finematics.com/polygon-commit-chain-explained/).
&gt; 	- [Funds have migrated](https://ethhole.link/) over the past year from ETH [via bridges to L2s and other L1s](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ethereum-bridges-four-months-on-10ee36f889ae).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- [TVL on L2s has boomed](https://l2beat.com/) as users flock to platforms with [cheaper transactions](https://l2fees.info/). Polygon for instance recently [flipped Ethereum in daily active addresses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/polygon-flips-ethereum-on-active-user-addresses/).
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan Selkis of Messari explained these concerns, suggesting that ETH could become cannibalized by competitors and L2s:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;[""Decentralization (specifically political decentralization) and architectural soundness have become secondary properties at best and willfully ignored at worst in the mercenary dominant market of 2021. Not every new chain has tossed decentralization aside, but many have. Even if Ethereum manages to hold off its largest non-EVM rivals, it will leak value to the rollup chains it leans on for scalability. ETH sits at ~60% market cap dominance among Layer 1s. That will either fall below 50% in 2022, or its Layer 2 rollup tokens will eat into its growth. Maybe both.] (https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf)""
&gt; 
&gt; ##Points of failure?
&gt; 
&gt; - While I agree with many of the points in [this article debunking the ""ETH is centralized"" mantra](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-isnt-decentralized-and-other-myths-ef2d132ee1fe), I think Ethereum still has some progress to make on the [**sociopolitical** and **architectural** aspects of decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274#.355j5eg0v):
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Sociopolitics**:
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Vitalik is a great steward of the project and has been [trying to remove himself as a single point of failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1b_S6Qp2Q&amp;t=656s). Anyone remember the [Vitalik death hoax?](https://fortune.com/2017/06/26/vitalik-death/)
&gt; 
&gt; 			- But as a 'high priest', Vitalik's [vision](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), [proposals](https://news.coincu.com/38718-vitalik-buterin-makes-proposal-eip-4488-to-lower-gas-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-in-the-short-term/) and opinions have preeminent influence and there's no doubt [he remains the 'face' of Ethereum](https://newsprees.com/vitalik-buterin-speaks-to-argentina-decentralization-goes-far-beyond-money/). The community looks to him for key deliverables like [roadmap updates](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402).
&gt; 
&gt;             * While [Ethereum development functions as a true open source project](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-2-0s-latest-strides-forward-13f63652e57d?gi=30830fb85bbd), I think there are a lot of benefits to having a pseudonymous, absent 'leader' like with Bitcoin and Monero. 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- There are also some concerns in my mind about the role of Joe Lubin and ConsenSys in [privatizing what should arguably be public goods](https://saitoofficial.medium.com/the-infura-problem-fe68866484ec). ConsenSys has been a huge player in [driving enterprise adoption](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-acquires-jpm-quorum/) - but they also own [key Ethereum infrastructure like Infura and MetaMask](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation/), which takes us to...
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Architecture**: 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Incidents like [Infura going down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) or the [Geth bug causing a chain split](https://decrypt.co/79597/ethereum-blockchain-splits-software-bug-network) highlight the Ethereum network's reliance on key, dominant infrastructure. Client and hosting diversity thus remains an issue:
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the mainnet (PoW): [~82% of nodes use Geth](https://www.ethernodes.org/), while [~69% of nodes run on hosting services](https://www.ethernodes.org/network-types)([e.g. AWS](https://decrypt.co/44321/70-of-ethereum-nodes-are-hosted-on-centralized-services)).
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the beacon chain (PoS): [64.8% of validators use Prysm](https://twitter.com/sproulM_/status/1451065804183662592).
&gt; 		
&gt;         - [Centralization of infrastructure has been an ongoing concern for the community](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-eth-2-0-could-resolve-the-long-running-centralization-debate-c416b394e54c) and I think clients and consensus infrastructure need to further diversify lest they remain points of failure.

Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from my [previous entry](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og1is6/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_ethereum/h4j6uap/). Per the [Cointest rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/cointest_policy#wiki_rules), this is my third and last time presenting the argument.
&gt; 
&gt; *Disclosure - I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; 
&gt; #`Part 1/2`
&gt; 
&gt; #**What is Ethereum even**
&gt; 
&gt; - The digital gold narrative of Bitcoin is easy to grok - it's scarce like gold, gold is valuable, BTC is valuable
&gt; 
&gt; - The value proposition for Ethereum is a bit harder to wrap one's head around. It has often been described as a 'world computer' given [the tagline](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) of a ""[smart contract](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-smart-contracts) and [decentralized application](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/decentralized-application) platform""
&gt; 
&gt; - But as [narratives shift](https://miro.medium.com/1*ZpdeufZXonF4IXP3NI9ssg.png), it may make more sense to now consider Ethereum as a *world economy* vs. a world computer - an economy with ETH as its native currency.
&gt; 
&gt;     - [JP Morgan recently described ETH as ""the backbone of the crypto-native economy""](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1387417522777956354/photo/1)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - Ethereum has also been described as the ""[foundation for building an alternative Internet-based financial system](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/ether-is-the-best-model-for-money)""
&gt; 
&gt;     - In 2020, [Ethereum processed $874 billion worth of dollar payments](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/market-updates/deep-dive-ethereum-economy), rivaling major consumer-facing systems like Zelle ($307 billion) and Paypal ($963 billion). In [Q1 2021 Ethereum settled $1.5 trillion in transactions](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1384676842045681664).
&gt; 
&gt;     - The gravitational pull of this 'Ethereum economy' is now attracting traditional/legacy financial actors:
&gt; 
&gt;         - [Visa rolls out settlement in USDC via the Ethereum blockchain](https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2021/03/26/digital-currency-comes-1616782388876.html) 
&gt; 
&gt;         - [The European Investment Bank issues a digital bond on the Ethereum blockchain](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain)
&gt; 
&gt;         - [DBS, J.P. Morgan and Temasek establish a platform to transform interbank value movements](https://www.jpmorgan.com/news/dbs-jpmorgan-and-temasek-to-establish-platform)
&gt; 
&gt; #**Ethereum as the Internet of Value**
&gt; 
&gt; - Well it's great that the Ethereum blockchain is processing transactions and moving value around, but why would that make ETH itself attractive or valuable? Isn't that what the existing financial system does already?
&gt; 
&gt; - As a programmable blockchain, ""[Ethereum is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games and apps that can't steal your data or censor you](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/)""
&gt; 
&gt;     - If we think about the Internet, it relies on [different layers and protocols to function](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fceb85f7f-b5ed-4b6f-a0ee-5fb62b536c6d_2304x1288.png). However - for the end user - the *application layer*  is the most meaningful for adding value to our day to day lives. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [In a similar fashion](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1e44105-0aec-403a-b88f-ed0fae50b0a7_1910x1284.png), the ecosystem of [dApps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/), [DeFi protocols](https://defipulse.com/), [DAOs](https://open-orgs.info/), and [NFTs](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces) that are [underpinned by Ethereum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ccd86ce-9180-4cf7-ab25-566147eb34bb_1250x856.png) hold tremendous value. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - To take one example, [DeFi](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi) seeks to increase ""[the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of the financial infrastructure. Moreover, the system's composability allows anyone to combine multiple applications and protocols, thereby creating new and exciting services](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2021/02/05/decentralized-finance-on-blockchain-and-smart-contract-based-financial-markets)"". The value of these new and exciting services are clear, with [over $100B locked](https://defipulse.com/) at the time of writing and increasing rapidly.
&gt; 
&gt; - Another crucial aspect of Ethereum as an 'Internet of Value' is the blockchain's usage as a settlement layer for *other* assets besides ETH
&gt; 
&gt;     - ‚ÄúTokenization‚Äù and the [ERC20 standard](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/what-is-erc20) lets anyone create an asset with digital scarcity.
&gt; 
&gt;     - The absolute number of tokens built on Ethereum and their combined marketcap [far outpace any other blockchain](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/images/uploads/2021/Sch21Q2Table1_20210205034434.jpg). The total market cap of the biggest ERC-20 tokens issued on top of the Ethereum blockchain rose [to more than $250 billion in March 2021](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/market-updates/deep-dive-ethereum-economy) 
&gt; 
&gt;     - As of February 2021, the total value of [stablecoins](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/) on the Ethereum blockchain [surpassed $30 billion](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/market-updates/deep-dive-ethereum-economy)
&gt; 
&gt;  - Even other assets like BTC can be deployed on Ethereum - currently [$11.9B worth of BTC 'lives' on Ethereum
&gt; ](https://btconethereum.com/)
&gt; 
&gt; #**Enterprise adoption**
&gt; 
&gt; - Given it's functionality as a programmable blockchain, it's no surprise that there's substantial corporate interest from organizations looking to build on Ethereum.
&gt; 
&gt; - For example, companies that have joined the [Ethereum Enterprise Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/) include: AMD, NY Mellon, Santander, Dell, Ernst &amp; Young, Fedex, Intel, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Microsoft, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, and SAP. 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt;     - [JP Morgan is experimenting with blockchain payments in space](https://www.jpmorgan.com/onyx/payments-in-space.htm)

&gt;     - [EY's Baseline protocol uses the Ethereum mainnet to automate business processes](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/) across companies with private ledgers and databases

Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by idevcg which won 1st place in the ALGO Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; - Algorand's Smart Contracts uses the AVM rather than the EVM, which is by far more common (the only chain that uses the AVM is Algorand), and therefore there is a lot more support for developers on EVM compatible chains. Furthermore, applications built on top of EVM compatible chains can easily be forked into other EVM compatible chains, while everything has to be built from scratch on Algorand.
&gt; 
&gt; - One huge limitation Algorand currently has (although it is planned that this limitation will be removed in the near future, it has not happened yet) is that each individual wallet address can only create 1000 unique NFTs and 10 smart contracts. This makes it extremely inconvenient for large NFT collections and especially Play To Earn Gaming.
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand's native programming language, TEAL, is a relatively low-level language, which means it is hard to program in and understand for many programmers who are used to high-level programming languages. There were also huge limitations with TEAL3 like not being able to back branch, which significantly limited what developers can do. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Currently, Algorand's DeFi TVL is [not even top 40](https://defillama.com/chains) of L1 and L2 chains. There is only a  single working DEX on Algorand, which went down for 2 weeks early January do to an exploit.
&gt; 
&gt; - Some ASAs (the Algorand equivalent to ERC20 tokens) have Freeze and Clawback, which essentially allows the token creator to freeze people's funds or even take them away at their discretion. This adds a huge layer of risk of bad actors being able to steal funds by taking control of the original ASA address, and is completely antithetical to the whole decentralization aspect of blockchains. Why use a blockchain if you want a centralized actor to control everything like with the banks we have today?
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand lags behind most other L1 chains in terms of Marketing. It is virtually unknown outside of Reddit. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand promised 46,000 TPS by the end of 2021, as well as hinted at announcements of CBDCs also in 2021, neither of which happened.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

&gt; First things first, Nano isn't scalable, it's monolithically validated, it can't shard/parallelize, it can't have L2s or state proofs

You can certainly parallelize the work within the machine of a single keyholder. And that's all you need to scale. What you can't do is have untrusting parties work on subsets of the ledger, which means the long-term economic incentives will move node operation out of reach of typical individuals and into the realm of institutions, i.e. groups of like-minded people such as businesses, governments, schools, watch-dog groups, or hobbyist groups.

This means money would no longer decentralized at an individual level, but it would still be decentralized at national and international level, with a fundamentally democratic voting process by the users of the network as to which nodes have a voice and which nodes they get their state information from. Whether that is an acceptable state of decentralization is subjective, but it's pretty clearly an improvement over the status quo. If you think some other protocol is better, we can discuss the relative merits.

&gt; But that's beside the point anyway, because you can't have decentralized services and smart contracts with a ""dumb"" detached settlement layer, no matter how perfect it is. If it takes a trusted transaction triggered by anyone but you to have your contract honoured, it's not a smart contract by definition. ""Nano can easily serve as the settlement protocol for smart contracts"" is plain wrong.

Maybe I'm mistaken about the current state of the art with smart contracts but my understanding is that no functionality is lost here. A smart contract platform would interact with Nano in two ways: (1) watching the ledger for a transaction to take place and doing stuff in response, and (2) executing transactions onto the ledger. I think we agree that the first case is easy enough, while second case requires money to be preemptively ""locked up"" so that it can be executed by the smart contract platform and is outside of the control of the untrusted individual. Yes, this limits the possible utility of the service, but isn't that true of all smart contract platforms? Nano has multi-signature capability, which I think should give it most of the capability need to work with a smart contract system.

&gt; I personally disagree, I think crypto's most added value is in decentralized services. A scalable DEX would be a bigger improvement over a traditional exchange than scalable decentralized money would be over USD 

I can agree with the benefit of a very limited DEX (basically, between Nano and Monero because of their respective and mutually exclusive properties). But beyond that, the utility of a DEX is limited by the utility of the things it can exchange, and I think there is little worth exchanging. Assets in the physical world don't work as mentioned above, and other digital currencies don't matter if they aren't going to be better currencies than Nano or Monero. Most of these smart contracts don't need to be currencies in the first place. BitTorrent is a decentralized service that works just fine without a currency involved. That were so few decentralized services out there before the cryptocurrency revolution speaks to the fact that there are either (a) not many use cases that would benefit or (b) they are difficult to start and get participation in, or some mixture of the two. Adding money to the mix has certainly made it easier to start them, but we have yet to see how many are genuinely useful and will retain long-term adoption after the speculation dies down.

&gt; Sure, we will need, say, issuers of tokenized stocks to be accountable, but there has never been nor will there ever be a way around this, and nobody has said otherwise. Once you're inside, you can use transparent applications instead of black boxes and this is a big deal in my book.

Sure, but if all you want is a transparent API and database, and you are ok with needing government participation, then we could easily have that today by just passing a law. That governments are typically bad at adopting technology, automation, and transparency into their operation is a different matter. In principle it seems like it should be just as easy to start a popular movement to modernize our governing technology as it is to start a popular movement to adopt a smart contract protocol.

&gt; and every payment coin's) ceiling. /r/nanocurrency fam mostly say yes, ""centralized services aren't the problem"" is usually the top answer whenever noobs ask about smart contracts with Nano.

It seems like this is your answer too, at least as it pertains to interaction with real-world assets as indicated above. So we are mostly in agreement by necessity, whether or not we think it the status quo is ""acceptable.""

&gt; You say the cart is being put before the horse by developing such applications (complex traditional shit ported to DeFi) before sufficient scalability is already in place, but I disagree on that too. Ride owners set up before the funfair opens, what's the big deal? It's not like you can do anything on the scalability front unless you're a brilliant low-level protocol developer, or break into the centralized service market where land has already been grabbed.

I don't think it's a big deal, people are free to make things that may not end up useful. I'm just here telling people where I think they should direct their energy (and ridiculous amounts of speculative money) first.

&gt; Payment coins don't get enough hype... guess why?

I'm not even sure that this is my sentiment. I think cryptocurrencies are a marginal improvement over existing payment technology and offer a few niche benefits, especially to people with less stable currencies or repressive governments. The average first-world consumer is not going to see a big change in their day to day life from this technology, except perhaps a more uniform and convenient payment processing experience in the long term. I view it as an interesting novelty technology that is best promoted by word of mouth and may someday reach mass adoption, like Wikipedia.

Instead, my main complaint is that the rest of the cryptosphere is overhyped, drowning out the marginal but real utility that something like Nano offers. The amount of public ill-will being garnered by Bitcoin mining or NFTs for instance is pretty damaging to the adoption rate of a payment protocol, IMO.",i30nr73,t1_i2kgoyy,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tp0qcc/at_first_i_thought_nano_was_too_good_to_be_true/i30nr73/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,0,,,
CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

There is literally zero inherent value in any of it. If everyone dumped any coin it could go to effectively zero and be dead. The only reason it goes the other way is someone pumping it up.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;

Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. Interoperability may be crypto's future - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but as Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)""
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/?context=10000). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20-30 for a token transfer or $60-100 for a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper on this and quantifies how ""[people are entirely ‚Äúlocked out‚Äù of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt; 
&gt; ##I drink your milkshake
&gt; 
&gt; - Having prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, Ethereum is now [focused on rollups to meet demand](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html).
&gt; 
&gt; -  However, some users may not care about decentralization - they want to participate in DeFi, NFTs, etc. without paying an arm and a leg and will use BSC, SOL or [sidechains that don't inherit ETH's security](https://finematics.com/polygon-commit-chain-explained/).
&gt; 	- [Funds have migrated](https://ethhole.link/) over the past year from ETH [via bridges to L2s and other L1s](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ethereum-bridges-four-months-on-10ee36f889ae).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- [TVL on L2s has boomed](https://l2beat.com/) as users flock to platforms with [cheaper transactions](https://l2fees.info/). Polygon for instance recently [flipped Ethereum in daily active addresses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/polygon-flips-ethereum-on-active-user-addresses/).
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan Selkis of Messari explained these concerns, suggesting that ETH could become cannibalized by competitors and L2s:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;[""Decentralization (specifically political decentralization) and architectural soundness have become secondary properties at best and willfully ignored at worst in the mercenary dominant market of 2021. Not every new chain has tossed decentralization aside, but many have. Even if Ethereum manages to hold off its largest non-EVM rivals, it will leak value to the rollup chains it leans on for scalability. ETH sits at ~60% market cap dominance among Layer 1s. That will either fall below 50% in 2022, or its Layer 2 rollup tokens will eat into its growth. Maybe both.] (https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf)""
&gt; 
&gt; ##Points of failure?
&gt; 
&gt; - While I agree with many of the points in [this article debunking the ""ETH is centralized"" mantra](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-isnt-decentralized-and-other-myths-ef2d132ee1fe), I think Ethereum still has some progress to make on the [**sociopolitical** and **architectural** aspects of decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274#.355j5eg0v):
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Sociopolitics**:
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Vitalik is a great steward of the project and has been [trying to remove himself as a single point of failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1b_S6Qp2Q&amp;t=656s). Anyone remember the [Vitalik death hoax?](https://fortune.com/2017/06/26/vitalik-death/)
&gt; 
&gt; 			- But as a 'high priest', Vitalik's [vision](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), [proposals](https://news.coincu.com/38718-vitalik-buterin-makes-proposal-eip-4488-to-lower-gas-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-in-the-short-term/) and opinions have preeminent influence and there's no doubt [he remains the 'face' of Ethereum](https://newsprees.com/vitalik-buterin-speaks-to-argentina-decentralization-goes-far-beyond-money/). The community looks to him for key deliverables like [roadmap updates](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402).
&gt; 
&gt;             * While [Ethereum development functions as a true open source project](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-2-0s-latest-strides-forward-13f63652e57d?gi=30830fb85bbd), I think there are a lot of benefits to having a pseudonymous, absent 'leader' like with Bitcoin and Monero. 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- There are also some concerns in my mind about the role of Joe Lubin and ConsenSys in [privatizing what should arguably be public goods](https://saitoofficial.medium.com/the-infura-problem-fe68866484ec). ConsenSys has been a huge player in [driving enterprise adoption](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-acquires-jpm-quorum/) - but they also own [key Ethereum infrastructure like Infura and MetaMask](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation/), which takes us to...
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Architecture**: 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Incidents like [Infura going down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) or the [Geth bug causing a chain split](https://decrypt.co/79597/ethereum-blockchain-splits-software-bug-network) highlight the Ethereum network's reliance on key, dominant infrastructure. Client and hosting diversity thus remains an issue:
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the mainnet (PoW): [~82% of nodes use Geth](https://www.ethernodes.org/), while [~69% of nodes run on hosting services](https://www.ethernodes.org/network-types)([e.g. AWS](https://decrypt.co/44321/70-of-ethereum-nodes-are-hosted-on-centralized-services)).
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the beacon chain (PoS): [64.8% of validators use Prysm](https://twitter.com/sproulM_/status/1451065804183662592).
&gt; 		
&gt;         - [Centralization of infrastructure has been an ongoing concern for the community](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-eth-2-0-could-resolve-the-long-running-centralization-debate-c416b394e54c) and I think clients and consensus infrastructure need to further diversify lest they remain points of failure.

Also see the points yourself:

Bitcoin being accepted as payment in some parts of the world... Suddenly SHIB and DOGE also are being touted for payments.

Then comes the NFT trend and suddenly SHIB also has a NFT marketplace. 

Now metaverse is a hot topic and they announced a upcoming project.

So what exactly was the point of the token when it was launched ? ***IT WAS A MEME AND A MONEY MAKING STRATERGY***

CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by idevcg which won 1st place in the ALGO Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; - Algorand's Smart Contracts uses the AVM rather than the EVM, which is by far more common (the only chain that uses the AVM is Algorand), and therefore there is a lot more support for developers on EVM compatible chains. Furthermore, applications built on top of EVM compatible chains can easily be forked into other EVM compatible chains, while everything has to be built from scratch on Algorand.
&gt; 
&gt; - One huge limitation Algorand currently has (although it is planned that this limitation will be removed in the near future, it has not happened yet) is that each individual wallet address can only create 1000 unique NFTs and 10 smart contracts. This makes it extremely inconvenient for large NFT collections and especially Play To Earn Gaming.
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand's native programming language, TEAL, is a relatively low-level language, which means it is hard to program in and understand for many programmers who are used to high-level programming languages. There were also huge limitations with TEAL3 like not being able to back branch, which significantly limited what developers can do. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Currently, Algorand's DeFi TVL is [not even top 40](https://defillama.com/chains) of L1 and L2 chains. There is only a  single working DEX on Algorand, which went down for 2 weeks early January do to an exploit.
&gt; 
&gt; - Some ASAs (the Algorand equivalent to ERC20 tokens) have Freeze and Clawback, which essentially allows the token creator to freeze people's funds or even take them away at their discretion. This adds a huge layer of risk of bad actors being able to steal funds by taking control of the original ASA address, and is completely antithetical to the whole decentralization aspect of blockchains. Why use a blockchain if you want a centralized actor to control everything like with the banks we have today?
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand lags behind most other L1 chains in terms of Marketing. It is virtually unknown outside of Reddit. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand promised 46,000 TPS by the end of 2021, as well as hinted at announcements of CBDCs also in 2021, neither of which happened.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#Bitcoin Cash Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 1st place in the Bitcoin Cash Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; # What is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin Cash is a [hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp) of Bitcoin. It was launched in 2017. [It has 32MB blocks instead of Bitcoin‚Äôs 1MB](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/2015/08/21/what-is-the-bitcoin-block-size-debate-and-why-does-it-matter/), so it can handle many more transactions per second (TPS). And that‚Äôs the main difference between BTC and BCH, as its goal was to tackle [Bitcoin‚Äôs scalability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_scalability_problem) without the second layer solutions.
&gt; 
&gt; # What are the cons of BCH?
&gt; 
&gt; **IT‚ÄôS CENTRALIZED**
&gt; 
&gt; BCH ‚Äúinherited‚Äù BTC‚Äôs supply distribution from July 2017 when it was launched but the supply held by large addresses [has become more concentrated over time](https://coinmetrics.substack.com/p/coin-metrics-state-of-the-network-2d3) (while BTC is even more decentralized today).
&gt; 
&gt; In 2019, [just two mining pools were able to perform a 51% attack](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2019/05/24/bitcoin-cash-miners-undo-attackers-transactions-with-51-attack/). And although it was done for a good cause ‚Äì to stop an unknown miner from exploiting a bug ‚Äì it can serve as a prove that BCH was centralized already back then.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **THE NARRATIVE IS ON BITCOIN‚ÄôS SIDE**
&gt; 
&gt; The value of Bitcoin has gone up more than 2,000% since July 2017 while BCH has stayed below its price from July 2017 most of the time, not to mention its [ATH price of $4,355](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-cash/) (it's 86% down from ATH as of 31.10.2021).
&gt; 
&gt; Also liquidity and real-world usability of Bitcoin Cash [is nowhere near that of Bitcoin](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash-whats-difference/#citation-4). It is clear that the great majority of investors chose Bitcoin after the 2017 hard fork and BCH is seen as an inferior copy.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **IT HAD ITS OWN HARD FORKS**
&gt; 
&gt; People cringe at Internet Computer‚Äôs name, but for me, Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) takes the cake. It‚Äôs a hard fork of Bitcoin Cash that took place in late 2018. It has even larger blocks than BCH ‚Äì [2GB](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/world-record-2-gigabyte-block-130000498.html).
&gt; 
&gt; In 2020, there was another hard fork that produced two new chains- Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Node. This shows that Bitcoin Cash has failed not only against Bitcoin, but had splits among its own community, further hurting its credibility.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **IT'S SCALABILITY COMES AT A COST**
&gt; 
&gt; Bigger blocks have certain [disadvantages](https://www.sfox.com/blog/is-bigger-better-how-to-evaluate-bitcoin-cash-based-on-block-size/). Running nodes when the blocks are big requires more resources. Also, the commissions from transaction fees are lower, which makes mining the coin less appealing. This might result in nodes being manageable only by big, private companies, making BCH even more centralized.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **ITS MAIN ADVANTAGE ISN‚ÄôT UTILIZED‚Ä¶**
&gt; 
&gt; Although BCH‚Äôs blocks can handle up to 32MB of data, [they have not reached even 2MB since they were introduced in 2018](https://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/size-btc-bch.html#3y). What's more, their average size is currently much lower than that of Bitcoin‚Äôs blocks.
&gt; 
&gt; Taking into consideration the point above about the disadvantages of bigger blocks, it makes you wonder why BCH would push for such big blocks when most of the time they don't even use 3% of their capacity.
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **‚Ä¶ AND EVEN IF IT WAS, THERE'S LIGHTNING NETWORK**
&gt; 
&gt; [SegWit](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/segwit-segregated-witness.asp) allows second layer solutions to be implemented on Bitcoin. One of those solutions is Lightning Network which has become very popular recently after being [adopted by El Salvador](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/lightning-network-bitcoin-usage-adoption-el-salvador) and [Twitter](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/118450/twitter-rolls-out-bitcoin-tipping-for-ios-users-via-lightning-looks-to-nfts-for-the-future).
&gt; 
&gt; Lightning Network effectively eliminates the main advantage of Bitcoin Cash by allowing faster and cheaper transactions with bitcoins. Even if BCH fully utilized its 32MB blocks, it wouldn't be able to compete with Lightening Network.
&gt; 
&gt; \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
&gt; 
&gt; **SUMMARY**
&gt; 
&gt; Bitcoin Cash is a much worse store of value than Bitcoin and now it is also losing the electronic cash narrative, since the growing adoption of [Lightning Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Network) makes Bitcoin a much cheaper and faster payment option.

CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by idevcg which won 1st place in the ALGO Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; - Algorand's Smart Contracts uses the AVM rather than the EVM, which is by far more common (the only chain that uses the AVM is Algorand), and therefore there is a lot more support for developers on EVM compatible chains. Furthermore, applications built on top of EVM compatible chains can easily be forked into other EVM compatible chains, while everything has to be built from scratch on Algorand.
&gt; 
&gt; - One huge limitation Algorand currently has (although it is planned that this limitation will be removed in the near future, it has not happened yet) is that each individual wallet address can only create 1000 unique NFTs and 10 smart contracts. This makes it extremely inconvenient for large NFT collections and especially Play To Earn Gaming.
&gt; 
&gt; - Algorand's native programming language, TEAL, is a relatively low-level language, which means it is hard to program in and understand for many programmers who are used to high-level programming languages. There were also huge limitations with TEAL3 like not being able to back branch, which significantly limited what developers can do. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Currently, Algorand's DeFi TVL is [not even top 40](https://defillama.com/chains) of L1 and L2 chains. There is only a  single working DEX on Algorand, which went down for 2 weeks early January do to an exploit.
&gt; 
&gt; - Some ASAs (the Algorand equivalent to ERC20 tokens) have Freeze and Clawback, which essentially allows the token creator to freeze people's funds or even take them away at their discretion. This adds a huge layer of risk of bad actors being able to steal funds by taking control of the original ASA address, and is completely antithetical to the whole decentralization aspect of blockchains. Why use a blockchain if you want a centralized actor to control everything like with the banks we have today?
&gt;

crimeo,"&gt; And then lending platforms that offer loans/savings accounts.

Why would I want to get a loan from somewhere that charges me even HIGHER rates than banks do (in order to be able to pass on very high APYs to get anyone to use it), with LESS regulation?

I wouldn't. Unless I'm a criminal or unless I'm part of a scheme to just rug pull all that money at some point and never actually pay out (which is just a criminal again). Which is not a good use case to list out.

&gt; Then with games you have splinterlands that uses NFTs for each card (think like Magic the Gathering) and you can buy/sell/trade/rent your cards with a click of the button.

You could do that with a normal traditional database and javascript as of like 2005.

&gt; The game is also very addicting and the cards are great investments - they have gone up 10x since 2019.

Also entirely possible with a normal database and no crypto. War Thunder for example allows you to trade and gain value on investments in certain vehicles without using any crypto. Just web code.

&gt; It will become a very positive hedge agaist inflation.

Nope, because the reason why inflation goes up is due to money printing which is just a roundabout tax. The minute you remove that tax option from your government, **they will just charge you more direct taxes** to make up the difference.

Go look at the income tax brackets in the 1960s just before the gold standard was dropped. They went up to like 90% income tax, and like 50% even for just normal well-off people. That is not a coincidence. 

So yes, technically it avoids inflation, but the money you would have lost to inflation will just be paid on April 15 instead, same difference to your long term wealth.

tranceology3,"&gt;You haven't explained any beneficial use case for any of these yet except the first one (gambling)

Well there is ""real"" gambling with crypto like an online casino. WINK is very popular and I've used it quite a bit. Super easy to play classic gambling games.

Defi is clearly huge $100s Billions huge. Look at dexed that use liquidity pools, those are very popular. And then lending platforms that offer loans/savings accounts. I'm earning ~20% APY with my stable coin (UST - Terra) on Anchor.

&gt;Long term that cannot by definition continue to be a source of utility, because the number only goes up with new adoption, so once everyone adopted it, this would stop being a benefit anymore. So why would they keep using it then after that?

I think with coins like BTC, it will turn into a global reserve and we will see countries, investment firms, other projects (Terra-UST) continents to buy always putting pressure upward. It will become a very positive hede agaist inflation.

Think Ethereum and their smart contacts.  The ETH coin is technically gas (fees) to process the network. As we are seeing Ethereum is growing more and more. Many apps are being developed on it.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Zarkorix which won 2nd place in the ALGO Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Disclaimer: ALGO is ~15% of my portfolio.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Solving the Blockchain Trilemma
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is a solution to the ""blockchain trilemma"" - the ability of a network to be simultaneously scalable, secure and decentralised. ALGO's TPS is 1k/s, with a 4s finality, 0.001 ALGO transaction fee and it offers L1 smart contracts - however the network will be upgraded in Q3-Q4 2021 to 45k/s TPS and 2.5s finality, ranking it toward the top for speed and scalability [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/120720-Algorand%202021%20Performance.pdf)
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralisation is achieved by the pure PoS (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which employs **algo**rithmic **rand**omness. Unlike delegated PoS (e.g. XTZ, ADA), PPoS does not employ pooled validators, thus minimizing the drive toward centralisation over time that dPOS suffers from. ALGO node running is permissionless - anybody with &gt;1 ALGO can run a node and theoretically participate in consensus. Moreover, the hardware requirements are extremely low - an ALGO node can be run on a low energy, $50 Raspberry Pi.
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of PPoS is the use of a randomised, weighted lottery that selects validators - known as VRF. This prevents any malicious actor(s) from attacking the network since the identities of the currently selected validators (who must be corrupted in order to carry out an attack) are not known until the block is already finalised. At 1-4k validators, PPoS is paradoxically superior to ETH 2.0's 150,000 nodes - because ETH's beacon chains are long-lived. By contrast, ALGO's random selections vary on both a *round* and *subround* basis - that is, block proposers, voters, vote certifiers all vary, across all steps of certifying a block. Unlike ETH 2.0, which makes a single node the 'king-of-the-hill' for a given round (and thus employs slashing to discourage this node from misbehaving), if a node misbehaves in ALGO, it is simply voted against by all other certifiers - no slashing required.
&gt; 
&gt; Governance (launching 1/10/21) will further decentralise the network by placing decisions concerning the network, tokenomics and which projects receive developer grants (see below) into the hands of ALGO holders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is fast, scalable, secure while remaining decentralised.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Carbon Negative
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand's pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism is extremely lightweight, consuming \~0.000008 kWh/tx (vs. 0.5479 kWh/tx in ADA - that's \~70,000x less energy, and 116250000x less energy than BTC) - with 4,000 active validators. Minting an NFT requires only 0.0000004 kg of CO2 [(Source).](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/sustainable-blockchain-calculating-the-carbon-footprint) This energy usage is 100%+ offset via carbon credits - locked up by an on-chain sustainability oracle, via smart contract, that analyses the energy used by each node. A partnership with ClimateTrade (amongst others) channels this funding into reforestation, peat-management and wind-energy projects at a global level [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/algorand-announcements/carbon_negative_announcement).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is eco-friendly, and the world's first carbon *negative* blockchain network.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Staking Rewards
&gt; 
&gt; ALGO currently offers a seamless staking experience, with an APY of \~5.75% - you simply hold ALGO in a custodial wallet to participate (i.e. you do not need to select a validator and there is no lock-up period). In other words, your ALGO remains liquid at all times. This, however, will be gradually phased out and replaced by Governance, which will increase APY to 7%-30% (depending on the number of participants) but which will require you to vote in every proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Developer Friendly &amp; Ecosystem
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is extremely accessible to developers [(Source 1)](https://developer.algorand.org/tutorials/) [(Source 2)](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/reference/sdks/): it supports development in Python, C++, GO, Java, Javascript and RUST - removing the need for developers to retrain or learn obscure or new languages (e.g. Haskell). ALGO's smart contract language, TEAL, is incredibly intuitive and can be accessed via Python (PyTEAL). As shown in Source 1, Algorand offers comprehensive and detailed documentation and tutorials (for free) to all prospective developers.
&gt; 
&gt; More importantly, \~$200-250m is available to support developers and 50+ grants have already been issued [(Source)](https://algorand.foundation/developers/developer-incentive-awards-program). In total, \~600-650 companies are currently developing on ALGO and intend to deploy DApps/ALGO-based services [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO has the ability to instantly attract developers, and is poised for an explosion in its ecosystem.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Academic Rigor
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand was founded by the Turing-award-winning, MIT professor Silvio Micali - and is backed by an excellent team with solid peer-reviewed academic prowess and publication record [(Source 1)](https://www.algorand.com/technology/research-innovation/research-papers) [(Source 2)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=silvio+micali&amp;btnG=). Silvio Micali conceived of and pioneered zero-knowledge proofs (among many other protocols) - a key, integral part of ETH 2.0 and the future of cryptography/cryptocurrencies. Such a respectable and trustworthy team boosts ALGO's chances of mass adoption, especially in the financial/institutional sectors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO's ability to form partnerships is bolstered by the prestige of its team.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Real World Use
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of Algorand is that it is *forkless* \- it is mathematically impossible for ALGO to fork [(Source)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439751930091X). This is extremely important for real-world usage + transactions. Businesses accepting ALGO (unlike 99% of other cryptos) will not only experience rapid finality but can trust that the transaction is not on a forked, branch of the blockchain that can be lost. This also applies to NFTs. Thus far, ALGO has seen major adoption, recently including:
&gt; 
&gt; * 70M South Americans (potentially 200M soon) using ALGO to issue + store COVID-19 passports [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/vitalpass-vaccine-tracing-latam/)
&gt; * BNext adopting ALGO for its $100b/year Spain&lt;-&gt;Latin American remittance service [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/bnext-announces-next-generation-remittance-service/)
&gt; * MAPay adopting ALGO to power $800m/year in healthcare payments for Bermuda [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/mapay-to-implement-blockchain-based-solutions-on-algorand)
&gt; * SIAE, one of the largest and oldest digital rights managements companies in the world, launched 4.5m NFTs onto ALGO - representing the work of 10,000 artists and which will involve $100m/year in royalties [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases/siae).
&gt; * ALGO was recently featured in a World Economic Forum (WEF) report on cryptocurrency - listed as a recommended ""VIP"" blockchain that solves issues with BTC/ETH and proof-of-stake [(Source)](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Getting_Started_Cryptocurrency_2021.pdf). This document will be seen by institutions, banks and economists worldwide.
&gt; 
&gt; The list goes on and on [Here.](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases)
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is already being deployed for large-scale and institutional solutions - despite only launching \~2y ago.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Ethereum Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #Ethereum Con Argument 
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclosure: I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; 
&gt; - ETH has been the subject of a lot of criticism over the years and the same points still seem to get recycled ([premine/founders](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owypvc/my_personal_investigation_into_ethereum_uncovers/), [DAO rollback](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/the-dao-hack-makerdao), [scalability/centralization](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qw2e32/eth_is_bad_and_i_am_tired_of_pretending_its_not/hl0bqo9/), [inflation/supply](https://www.theheldreport.com/p/bitcoin-vs-ethereum)). There are a ton of rebuttals online for the most common Con arguments - [see here](https://np.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/najp2c/addressing_common_criticisms_about_ethereum/) and [here](https://medium.com/@adamscochran/the-10k-audit-42c100dd32bb) for a start. 
&gt; 
&gt; - That being said, there are definitely some legitimate concerns about ETH to consider: 
&gt; 
&gt; ##Gotta pay the troll toll
&gt; 
&gt; - As a protocol, Ethereum is an '[empire](https://www.finder.com.au\/brave-new-worlds-cosmos-blockchain-and-social-evolution)', a self-contained ecosystem with [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- But the downside of a 'one chain to rule them all' approach is that it locks users into using the system and paying gas fees in ETH. Interoperability may be crypto's future - [EVM](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/ethereum-virtual-machine-evm) is certainly an industry standard, but as Do Kwon of LUNA said recently: ""[Maybe it's a bad idea to stick all the applications into one global computer. Maybe it just makes sense to have a multi-chain future.](https://twitter.com/MessariCrypto/status/1439969124550119431)""
&gt; 
&gt; - We all know [gas fees](https://www.gasprice.io/) on ETH are a pain in the ass. 
&gt;     -  A lot of complaints about gas are misguided or uninformed, not understanding the [blockchain trilemma](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/blockchain-trilemma-decentralization-scalability-definition), mistakenly believing EIP1559 was supposed to lower gas fees (vs. [making them more predictable](https://pintail.xyz/posts/gas-market-analysis/)), or suggesting that ['gas fees are high, no one will use Ethereum'](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qikr7r/a_10k_eth_is_not_unrealistic_it_is_inevitable/hik9pet/?context=10000). 
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High gas fees are in fact an indication of usage, of [people competing to use the chain](https://cryptofees.info/) - but this makes ETH a victim of its own success.
&gt; 
&gt; - Paying [$20-30 for a token transfer or $60-100 for a Uniswap trade](https://etherscan.io/gastracker) is just not feasible for users with less capital - [they get priced out of using the chain](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/qdi9i8/ive_tried_to_use_ethereum_1015_times_over_the/).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- A really interesting article dives deeper on this and quantifies how ""[people are entirely ‚Äúlocked out‚Äù of their funds since it‚Äôd cost more in transaction fees to move the funds than the funds are actually worth.](https://medium.com/geekculture/value-fragmentation-8c8336f97cfd)"" At the time of writing the total 'lost value' of ERC20s was $600M, which doesn't include ETH itself or NFTs. 
&gt; 
&gt; - Which brings us to competition and scalability:
&gt; 
&gt; ##I drink your milkshake
&gt; 
&gt; - Having prioritized decentralization and security at the expense of scalability, Ethereum is now [focused on rollups to meet demand](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html).
&gt; 
&gt; -  However, some users may not care about decentralization - they want to participate in DeFi, NFTs, etc. without paying an arm and a leg and will use BSC, SOL or [sidechains that don't inherit ETH's security](https://finematics.com/polygon-commit-chain-explained/).
&gt; 	- [Funds have migrated](https://ethhole.link/) over the past year from ETH [via bridges to L2s and other L1s](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/ethereum-bridges-four-months-on-10ee36f889ae).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- [TVL on L2s has boomed](https://l2beat.com/) as users flock to platforms with [cheaper transactions](https://l2fees.info/). Polygon for instance recently [flipped Ethereum in daily active addresses](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/10/04/polygon-flips-ethereum-on-active-user-addresses/).
&gt; 
&gt; - Ryan Selkis of Messari explained these concerns, suggesting that ETH could become cannibalized by competitors and L2s:
&gt; 
&gt; 	&gt;[""Decentralization (specifically political decentralization) and architectural soundness have become secondary properties at best and willfully ignored at worst in the mercenary dominant market of 2021. Not every new chain has tossed decentralization aside, but many have. Even if Ethereum manages to hold off its largest non-EVM rivals, it will leak value to the rollup chains it leans on for scalability. ETH sits at ~60% market cap dominance among Layer 1s. That will either fall below 50% in 2022, or its Layer 2 rollup tokens will eat into its growth. Maybe both.] (https://messari.io/pdf/messari-report-crypto-theses-for-2022.pdf)""
&gt; 
&gt; ##Points of failure?
&gt; 
&gt; - While I agree with many of the points in [this article debunking the ""ETH is centralized"" mantra](https://medium.com/swlh/ethereum-isnt-decentralized-and-other-myths-ef2d132ee1fe), I think Ethereum still has some progress to make on the [**sociopolitical** and **architectural** aspects of decentralization](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274#.355j5eg0v):
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Sociopolitics**:
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Vitalik is a great steward of the project and has been [trying to remove himself as a single point of failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3x1b_S6Qp2Q&amp;t=656s). Anyone remember the [Vitalik death hoax?](https://fortune.com/2017/06/26/vitalik-death/)
&gt; 
&gt; 			- But as a 'high priest', Vitalik's [vision](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/12/06/endgame.html), [proposals](https://news.coincu.com/38718-vitalik-buterin-makes-proposal-eip-4488-to-lower-gas-fees-for-ethereum-layer-2-in-the-short-term/) and opinions have preeminent influence and there's no doubt [he remains the 'face' of Ethereum](https://newsprees.com/vitalik-buterin-speaks-to-argentina-decentralization-goes-far-beyond-money/). The community looks to him for key deliverables like [roadmap updates](https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1466411377107558402).
&gt; 
&gt;             * While [Ethereum development functions as a true open source project](https://media.consensys.net/ethereum-2-0s-latest-strides-forward-13f63652e57d?gi=30830fb85bbd), I think there are a lot of benefits to having a pseudonymous, absent 'leader' like with Bitcoin and Monero. 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- There are also some concerns in my mind about the role of Joe Lubin and ConsenSys in [privatizing what should arguably be public goods](https://saitoofficial.medium.com/the-infura-problem-fe68866484ec). ConsenSys has been a huge player in [driving enterprise adoption](https://consensys.net/blog/news/consensys-acquires-jpm-quorum/) - but they also own [key Ethereum infrastructure like Infura and MetaMask](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/02/consensys-shareholders-readying-legal-action-over-share-valuation/), which takes us to...
&gt; 
&gt; 	- **Architecture**: 
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Incidents like [Infura going down](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/ethereums-infura-iating-outage-revives-decentralization-concerns) or the [Geth bug causing a chain split](https://decrypt.co/79597/ethereum-blockchain-splits-software-bug-network) highlight the Ethereum network's reliance on key, dominant infrastructure. Client and hosting diversity thus remains an issue:
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the mainnet (PoW): [~82% of nodes use Geth](https://www.ethernodes.org/), while [~69% of nodes run on hosting services](https://www.ethernodes.org/network-types)([e.g. AWS](https://decrypt.co/44321/70-of-ethereum-nodes-are-hosted-on-centralized-services)).
&gt; 
&gt; 			- On the beacon chain (PoS): [64.8% of validators use Prysm](https://twitter.com/sproulM_/status/1451065804183662592).
&gt; 		
&gt;         - [Centralization of infrastructure has been an ongoing concern for the community](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-eth-2-0-could-resolve-the-long-running-centralization-debate-c416b394e54c) and I think clients and consensus infrastructure need to further diversify lest they remain points of failure.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #NFT Pro Argument (Part 1/2)
&gt; 
&gt; Expanding on [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0oyl/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h6ek70r/).
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them*.
&gt; 
&gt; - **TLDR**: Anyone paying attention this year is aware of NFTs - they have exploded into mainstream consciousness in a way that many of our favorite projects haven't. While some of the crazy valuations indicate a speculative frenzy, as a technology I think NFTs are here to stay because they: (1) are part of a larger interest in developing the '[metaverse](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html)', (2) increase access and velocity of traditionally illiquid markets, and (3) don't just impact the collectibles space but [extend trustless ownership and verification to a variety of other domains
&gt; ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/top-7-nft-use-cases).
&gt; 
&gt; ##NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While much of the attention has centered on NFTs in the ETH ecosystem, there are numerous frameworks for their issuance:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- In addition to the [ERC-721](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/erc-721)/[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standards on ETH, NFTs are also supported by [Tezos](https://www.mclaren.com/racing/partners/tezos/), [Flow](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-flow-dapper-labs), [Zilliqa](https://blog.zilliqa.com/polaris-sports-nets-exclusive-nft-deal-featuring-global-football-giants-in-partnership-with-zilliqa-379b99bcdcbd), [Hedera](https://hedera.com/learning/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft) and [BSC](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/top-reasons-why-bsc-is-the-best-blockchain-for-nfts/) (BEP-721/ BEP-1155) etc., with [planned integration on Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/).
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the Kraken Intelligence NFT report](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ##2021: Year of the NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While NFTs have [been around since 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/), interest picked up in 2017 with the introduction of [CryptoKitties](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/meet-cryptokitties-the-new-digital-beanie-babies-selling-for-100k.html) and [CryptoPunks](https://mashable.com/article/cryptopunks-ethereum-art-collectibles) on the ETH network.
&gt; 
&gt; - However, the public awareness and resulting demand for NFTs in 2021 absolutely dwarf that early excitement:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- The [NFT market tripled in 2020 to $250M](https://nonfungible.com/subscribe/nft-report-2020), only to quickly be eclipsed by [$2B in sales in Q1 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/nft-sales-top-2-billion-in-first-quarter-with-interest-from-newcomers.html). As of Q4 2021, [secondary sales have exceeded $10B](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masonnystrom/issues/the-multichain-nft-market-798081).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High profile sales received widespread media attention (e.g. [Christie's auction of an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html)), while the amount of [established brands entering the market](https://decrypt.co/62411/taco-bell-to-charmin-10-big-brands-jumping-on-nft-bandwagon) continue to increase.
&gt; 
&gt; 		- NFTs have penetrated [sports](https://dappradar.com/flow/collectibles/nba-topshot), [gaming](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-spurring-a-digital-land-grabin-videogame-worlds-11616414401), [music](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-music-industrys-latest-big-hit-11616491801), [cinema](https://variety.com/2021/film/global/nft-movies-first-film-sale-claude-lanzmann-documentary-1234930343/), [clothing](https://thenextweb.com/news/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent), [porn](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/crypto-nft-sex-workers-porn-performers-1142030/), and [academia](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/05/28/uc-berkeley-will-auction-nfts-2-nobel-prize-patents).
&gt; 
&gt;         - Some notable NFTs include: [the dictionary definition for NFT](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thanks-to-merriam-webster-you-can-now-own-the-nft-of-the-definition-of-nft-301288201.html), famous memes [(4)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.html) [(5)](https://blog.originprotocol.com/charlie-bit-my-finger-makes-internet-history-again-1e4a3c54db65), [Reddit avatars](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6ms0b/introducing_cryptosnoosa_very_reddit_take_on_nfts/), [a Picasso painting](https://mashable.com/article/picasso-nft), [a tennis pro's arm](https://decrypt.co/61248/this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft), [Jack Dorsey's first tweet](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-dorsey-nft/twitter-boss-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-sold-for-2-9-million-as-an-nft-idUSKBN2BE2KJ) and [Tim Berners-Lee's source code](https://sothebys-com.brightspotcdn.com/94/a2/742444404b45ae855523a58edcd2/www-pr-en.pdf).
&gt; 
&gt;     - With this increase in public attention also came [debate about the environmental impact of NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change).
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Personally, for the purposes of the Cointest I disregard this narrative as a con argument since it conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains specifically.

SouthernZhao,"&gt;It probably will be the sort of thing we will have to wait 20-30 years for the technology to catch up, but the new web being completely decentralized will change so much about how technology is used. Not having centralized servers and databases means we will see applications we've never dreamed of, used in ways we've never thought of.

From where do you take this optimism? ""The web"" was decentralized maybe in the nineties, but now it isn't, and everything crypto has become centralized as soon as more than a few people actually used it (Coinbase, OpenSea for NFTs, Infura for accessing the Ethereum chain etc etc.). Maybe Bitcoin and Ethereum can still be called decentralized, but they are prohibitively slow and expensive. What makes you think this is just a matter of technological advancements? The technology has been around for years, and everything developed on it is either practically unusable or heavily centralised (and/or a scam).",i2u4dbx,t1_i2r2wy7,/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/tsaoza/getting_an_uber_is_a_simple_concept_but_may_be/i2u4dbx/,1,CryptoCurrency,t5_2wlj3,r/CryptoCurrency,0,,,
CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #NFT Pro Argument (Part 1/2)
&gt; 
&gt; Expanding on [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0oyl/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h6ek70r/).
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them*.
&gt; 
&gt; - **TLDR**: Anyone paying attention this year is aware of NFTs - they have exploded into mainstream consciousness in a way that many of our favorite projects haven't. While some of the crazy valuations indicate a speculative frenzy, as a technology I think NFTs are here to stay because they: (1) are part of a larger interest in developing the '[metaverse](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html)', (2) increase access and velocity of traditionally illiquid markets, and (3) don't just impact the collectibles space but [extend trustless ownership and verification to a variety of other domains
&gt; ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/top-7-nft-use-cases).
&gt; 
&gt; ##NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While much of the attention has centered on NFTs in the ETH ecosystem, there are numerous frameworks for their issuance:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- In addition to the [ERC-721](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/erc-721)/[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standards on ETH, NFTs are also supported by [Tezos](https://www.mclaren.com/racing/partners/tezos/), [Flow](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-flow-dapper-labs), [Zilliqa](https://blog.zilliqa.com/polaris-sports-nets-exclusive-nft-deal-featuring-global-football-giants-in-partnership-with-zilliqa-379b99bcdcbd), [Hedera](https://hedera.com/learning/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft) and [BSC](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/top-reasons-why-bsc-is-the-best-blockchain-for-nfts/) (BEP-721/ BEP-1155) etc., with [planned integration on Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/).
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the Kraken Intelligence NFT report](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ##2021: Year of the NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While NFTs have [been around since 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/), interest picked up in 2017 with the introduction of [CryptoKitties](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/meet-cryptokitties-the-new-digital-beanie-babies-selling-for-100k.html) and [CryptoPunks](https://mashable.com/article/cryptopunks-ethereum-art-collectibles) on the ETH network.
&gt; 
&gt; - However, the public awareness and resulting demand for NFTs in 2021 absolutely dwarf that early excitement:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- The [NFT market tripled in 2020 to $250M](https://nonfungible.com/subscribe/nft-report-2020), only to quickly be eclipsed by [$2B in sales in Q1 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/nft-sales-top-2-billion-in-first-quarter-with-interest-from-newcomers.html). As of Q4 2021, [secondary sales have exceeded $10B](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masonnystrom/issues/the-multichain-nft-market-798081).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High profile sales received widespread media attention (e.g. [Christie's auction of an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html)), while the amount of [established brands entering the market](https://decrypt.co/62411/taco-bell-to-charmin-10-big-brands-jumping-on-nft-bandwagon) continue to increase.
&gt; 
&gt; 		- NFTs have penetrated [sports](https://dappradar.com/flow/collectibles/nba-topshot), [gaming](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-spurring-a-digital-land-grabin-videogame-worlds-11616414401), [music](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-music-industrys-latest-big-hit-11616491801), [cinema](https://variety.com/2021/film/global/nft-movies-first-film-sale-claude-lanzmann-documentary-1234930343/), [clothing](https://thenextweb.com/news/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent), [porn](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/crypto-nft-sex-workers-porn-performers-1142030/), and [academia](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/05/28/uc-berkeley-will-auction-nfts-2-nobel-prize-patents).
&gt; 
&gt;         - Some notable NFTs include: [the dictionary definition for NFT](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thanks-to-merriam-webster-you-can-now-own-the-nft-of-the-definition-of-nft-301288201.html), famous memes [(4)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.html) [(5)](https://blog.originprotocol.com/charlie-bit-my-finger-makes-internet-history-again-1e4a3c54db65), [Reddit avatars](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6ms0b/introducing_cryptosnoosa_very_reddit_take_on_nfts/), [a Picasso painting](https://mashable.com/article/picasso-nft), [a tennis pro's arm](https://decrypt.co/61248/this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft), [Jack Dorsey's first tweet](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-dorsey-nft/twitter-boss-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-sold-for-2-9-million-as-an-nft-idUSKBN2BE2KJ) and [Tim Berners-Lee's source code](https://sothebys-com.brightspotcdn.com/94/a2/742444404b45ae855523a58edcd2/www-pr-en.pdf).
&gt; 
&gt;     - With this increase in public attention also came [debate about the environmental impact of NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change).
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Personally, for the purposes of the Cointest I disregard this narrative as a con argument since it conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains specifically.

Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by roberthonker which won 3rd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; **Taken from u\/wargizmo's submission from last round**
&gt; 
&gt; NFT stands for non-fungible token, which is a piece of data stored in a digital ledger that is completely unique and non-interchangeable. This sets it apart from a regular unit of cryptocurrency (such as 1 Bitcoin) which will always be equivalent to every other unit of the same value of that same cryptocurrency. 
&gt; 
&gt; NFTs are usually associated with a particular digital or physical asset, such as a jpeg, a piece of real estate, a piece of music, a ticket or an item in a video game. 
&gt; 
&gt; **Unique advantages of NFTs:**
&gt; 
&gt; **Immutable + Unique**
&gt; 
&gt; The combination of being both unique, and unable to be changed, forged or obfuscated in any way makes NFTs a game changer in hundreds of industries around the world.
&gt; 
&gt; **Programmable**
&gt; 
&gt; In addition, NFTs can be programmed to perform all kinds of functions through the use of smart contracts. For example, a content creator can program an NFT to pay out royalties whenever an asset he created changes hands.
&gt; 
&gt; **Decentralisation of ownership**
&gt; 
&gt; Proof of ownership is no longer in the hands of governments, publishers and other entities, which are vulnerable to corruption, malicious actors and insolvency. 
&gt; 
&gt; &amp;#x200B;
&gt; 
&gt; **Use cases**
&gt; 
&gt; * **Identity.** NFTs can be used to uniquely identify a person. Whereas previously an identification document could be forged, and even a digital identity on a database can be changed by a hacker, or a bad actor. An NFT identity document on a blockchain is a permanent record for the person in possession of it.
&gt; * **Permanent records.** NFTs can be used to record personal achievements, such as academic achievements and prizes, it can eliminate forgery and fake records. NFTs can also be used to record criminal activity, which has often been easy for people to hide when travelling interstate or internationally. 
&gt; * **Gaming.** NFTs can prove ownership of a video game item. No longer do we need to worry about people figuring out how to 'dupe' items in-game. The NFT is the ultimate way to ensure your game and the items within it are secure. It also allows the players to truly own their in-game assets and to be able to trade them with other players.
&gt; * **Content creators.** NFTs can be used to prove ownership of both digital and physical assets, as well as be used as a means to distribute royalties to content creators. This has many uses in art, music and other creative industries. It's a way to ensure content creators are compensated for their work, while avoiding centralised publishers, which may not be acting in the creator's best interest.
&gt; * **Physical asset ownership.** NFTs are increasingly being used to prove ownership of physical assets, like property. In many countries real estate ownership is often disputed and vulnerable to corrupt governments and other agents. An NFT can prove immutable ownership of a piece of land and is resistant to this kind of corruption.
&gt; * **Collectibles.** NFTs can represent collectible items, both digital and physical, and can be a proof that something is genuine. One could, for example, print a copy of a collectible card and claim it as real, an NFT solves this issue.
&gt; * **Tickets and passes.** Tickets to concerts and events can be tokenised as NFTs to both prove that ticket-holders are genuine as well as restrict scalping and re-selling, should the event organisers wish. 
&gt; * **Anti-piracy.** NFTs can be used to confirm genuine ownership of content, such as games, software, and films. A quick check that someone is in possession of the NFT can eliminate piracy and ensure content creators get paid for their work.

AinNoWayBoi61,"The problem with attempts at monetizing gameplay is that it's very meaningless for 99% of people. Any game that has a grindy aspect for money will be bidded down to the point that no one cares. For example, if it takes an hour to produce 1 GameCoin, you might make a few per week but it will never be worth your time to play for it because some Asian kid will multibox with 10 accounts 24/7 to sell 1680 coins a week. You will never touch that aspect of the game and instead just pay that kid a penny for all the coins you need. I have yet to see a good implementation. I feel like all the games now are proof of concepts and gimmicks. This tech needs to be subtly applied behind the scenes for select features in a original game concept. For example CSGO is a good example. Have a good and independently fun original game idea, just how CSGO created the bomb plant/defuse concept and then just use the nfts for the skin marketplace. 

The biggest reason against it is just how unnecessary cryptos is.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

Their Genki token which is created by staking these nfts can later be used to mint more playable nfts which can then be rented to players who don't own the assets. The value of the tokens are directly proportional to the value of of the nfts as the next two collections can only be minted by their Genki token.

Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

JustARegularGuy,"Yeah, the way I envision this future state is kind of a two factor approach when recording transactions.

Let's say I want to sell my car. My car would theoretically be registered against some NFT. Just like we do with VIN and car titles.

I want to sell my car, so I list it on an app. When I go to list it the app asks for the VIN and the runs some look up magic, to find the corresponding NFT. An alert of some kind is sent to the wallet that owns the NFT saying the car associated with this NFT is being listed for sale. That alert would pop up on my phone and I would authenticate. 

When the sale happens the buyer will send some form of payment to the seller that is contingent on receiving the NFT. The NFT transfer from the seller is contingent on receiving payment. When both parties agree that they have completed the transaction the transaction locks into place. This would be kind of like an Escrow service. The seller puts the NFT in escrow and the buyer puts cash in escrow. When both agree to the funds are distributed accordingly. If one rejects the funds are returned to the respective owners. 

If the seller tries to keep the car after successful transaction the NFT would show ownership is now the buyers and the car is effectively stolen.

This is how modern transactions work for the most part. But a well built digital exchange of titles does not exist. You have to register the transaction after it takes place currently. An NFT market place might allow for the registration of the transaction to happen real time.

Additionally, having a house title and a car title are two totally separate entities. If NFTs become a sort of ""universal title"" (paging /r/squaredcircle), there might be an opportunity to have a single digital wallet for all your important assets. You could sell your car and tv and house all with the same transaction process.

&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Blendzi0r which won 2nd place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; NFTs, Non-Fungible Tokens, are tokens that have unique hash IDs. This makes it **possible to always indicate the original** one even if there are countless NFTs that look exactly the same. Blockchain stores all the data about minted (created) NFTs and this data **cannot be altered**. Therefore, NFTs are an incredibly reliable tool when it comes to **verifying ownership and legitimacy of various assets**, e.g. pieces of art, tickets, licences, certificates and many more.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; In the case of blockchains like Ethereum, which are decentralized and well-established, you can be sure that [NFTs that you create on such blockchains are secure](https://www.artshub.com.au\/news/opinions-analysis/nfts-the-pros-and-cons-262268-2370580/) and no one powerful entity can remove or modify them.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; What‚Äôs more, [NFTs can have their own smart contracts](https://medium.com/lansaar/nfts-and-smart-contracts-6c4c5516d5a0). You can e.g. add a smart contract for royalties ‚Äì each time your NFT is sold/used, you will receive a royalty payment that you set beforehand yourself. And, again, the fact that everything is visible on blockchain makes it very transparent for any transacting party ‚Äì everyone can take a look at the smart contract. And no one can alter it without your consent.
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt; NFTs can also be used for **storing important data**. Not only is the data safe on the blockchain from physical damage, but it also cannot be secretly modified since **every change is recorded forever** on the blockchain.

CointestAdmin,"#Ethereum Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the Ethereum Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from my [previous entry](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og1is6/rcryptocurrency_cointest_top_10_category_ethereum/h4j6uap/). Per the [Cointest rules](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/cointest_policy#wiki_rules), this is my third and last time presenting the argument.
&gt; 
&gt; *Disclosure - I currently hold a position in ETH, ~53% of my current portfolio value*
&gt; 
&gt; #`Part 1/2`
&gt; 
&gt; #**What is Ethereum even**
&gt; 
&gt; - The digital gold narrative of Bitcoin is easy to grok - it's scarce like gold, gold is valuable, BTC is valuable
&gt; 
&gt; - The value proposition for Ethereum is a bit harder to wrap one's head around. It has often been described as a 'world computer' given [the tagline](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/) of a ""[smart contract](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/what-are-smart-contracts) and [decentralized application](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/decentralized-application) platform""
&gt; 
&gt; - But as [narratives shift](https://miro.medium.com/1*ZpdeufZXonF4IXP3NI9ssg.png), it may make more sense to now consider Ethereum as a *world economy* vs. a world computer - an economy with ETH as its native currency.
&gt; 
&gt;     - [JP Morgan recently described ETH as ""the backbone of the crypto-native economy""](https://twitter.com/santiagoroel/status/1387417522777956354/photo/1)
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - Ethereum has also been described as the ""[foundation for building an alternative Internet-based financial system](https://newsletter.thedefiant.io/p/ether-is-the-best-model-for-money)""
&gt; 
&gt;     - In 2020, [Ethereum processed $874 billion worth of dollar payments](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/market-updates/deep-dive-ethereum-economy), rivaling major consumer-facing systems like Zelle ($307 billion) and Paypal ($963 billion). In [Q1 2021 Ethereum settled $1.5 trillion in transactions](https://twitter.com/RyanWatkins_/status/1384676842045681664).
&gt; 
&gt;     - The gravitational pull of this 'Ethereum economy' is now attracting traditional/legacy financial actors:
&gt; 
&gt;         - [Visa rolls out settlement in USDC via the Ethereum blockchain](https://usa.visa.com/visa-everywhere/blog/bdp/2021/03/26/digital-currency-comes-1616782388876.html) 
&gt; 
&gt;         - [The European Investment Bank issues a digital bond on the Ethereum blockchain](https://www.eib.org/en/press/all/2021-141-european-investment-bank-eib-issues-its-first-ever-digital-bond-on-a-public-blockchain)
&gt; 
&gt;         - [DBS, J.P. Morgan and Temasek establish a platform to transform interbank value movements](https://www.jpmorgan.com/news/dbs-jpmorgan-and-temasek-to-establish-platform)
&gt; 
&gt; #**Ethereum as the Internet of Value**
&gt; 
&gt; - Well it's great that the Ethereum blockchain is processing transactions and moving value around, but why would that make ETH itself attractive or valuable? Isn't that what the existing financial system does already?
&gt; 
&gt; - As a programmable blockchain, ""[Ethereum is for more than payments. It's a marketplace of financial services, games and apps that can't steal your data or censor you](https://ethereum.org/en/what-is-ethereum/)""
&gt; 
&gt;     - If we think about the Internet, it relies on [different layers and protocols to function](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fceb85f7f-b5ed-4b6f-a0ee-5fb62b536c6d_2304x1288.png). However - for the end user - the *application layer*  is the most meaningful for adding value to our day to day lives. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [In a similar fashion](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1e44105-0aec-403a-b88f-ed0fae50b0a7_1910x1284.png), the ecosystem of [dApps](https://ethereum.org/en/dapps/), [DeFi protocols](https://defipulse.com/), [DAOs](https://open-orgs.info/), and [NFTs](https://dappradar.com/nft/marketplaces) that are [underpinned by Ethereum](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ccd86ce-9180-4cf7-ab25-566147eb34bb_1250x856.png) hold tremendous value. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - To take one example, [DeFi](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/the-complete-beginners-guide-to-decentralized-finance-defi) seeks to increase ""[the efficiency, transparency, and accessibility of the financial infrastructure. Moreover, the system's composability allows anyone to combine multiple applications and protocols, thereby creating new and exciting services](https://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2021/02/05/decentralized-finance-on-blockchain-and-smart-contract-based-financial-markets)"". The value of these new and exciting services are clear, with [over $100B locked](https://defipulse.com/) at the time of writing and increasing rapidly.
&gt; 
&gt; - Another crucial aspect of Ethereum as an 'Internet of Value' is the blockchain's usage as a settlement layer for *other* assets besides ETH
&gt; 
&gt;     - ‚ÄúTokenization‚Äù and the [ERC20 standard](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/getting-started/crypto-education/what-is-erc20) lets anyone create an asset with digital scarcity.
&gt; 
&gt;     - The absolute number of tokens built on Ethereum and their combined marketcap [far outpace any other blockchain](https://files.stlouisfed.org/files/htdocs/publications/images/uploads/2021/Sch21Q2Table1_20210205034434.jpg). The total market cap of the biggest ERC-20 tokens issued on top of the Ethereum blockchain rose [to more than $250 billion in March 2021](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/market-updates/deep-dive-ethereum-economy) 
&gt; 
&gt;     - As of February 2021, the total value of [stablecoins](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/) on the Ethereum blockchain [surpassed $30 billion](https://www.coinbase.com/learn/market-updates/deep-dive-ethereum-economy)
&gt; 
&gt;  - Even other assets like BTC can be deployed on Ethereum - currently [$11.9B worth of BTC 'lives' on Ethereum
&gt; ](https://btconethereum.com/)
&gt; 
&gt; #**Enterprise adoption**
&gt; 
&gt; - Given it's functionality as a programmable blockchain, it's no surprise that there's substantial corporate interest from organizations looking to build on Ethereum.
&gt; 
&gt; - For example, companies that have joined the [Ethereum Enterprise Alliance](https://entethalliance.org/) include: AMD, NY Mellon, Santander, Dell, Ernst &amp; Young, Fedex, Intel, JP Morgan Chase Bank, Microsoft, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, and SAP. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [Microsoft won a Gartner Supply Chain Breakthrough of the Year award in 2021 for their e2e item traceability solution built on Ethereum](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-03-18-gartner-announces-supply-chain-winners-of-the-2021-power-of-the-profession-award)

&gt;     - [EY's Baseline protocol uses the Ethereum mainnet to automate business processes](https://docs.baseline-protocol.org/) across companies with private ledgers and databases

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Chikkin1013 which won 3rd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; *Note: as most argument against NFT's have been made already, I will give more nuanced explanations, advance a pre-existing argument, or explore unexplored arguments. I will @ original posters if I add onto a pre-existing argument*.
&gt; 
&gt; * **Ownership of an NFT is a metaphysical ownership of assets**  
&gt; *Note: nuancing* u\/MrMoustacheMan *and* u\/idevcg's *arguments*  
&gt; \&gt; Let us begin with what happens when you purchase an NFT.[You own not the actual asset](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/what-you-need-to-know-intellectual-2201399/) \- whether that be a png, jpg (or even the land/yacht, when the time comes) - but the *metadata* signed by the seller that *claims* the ownership of a *digital asset* (we will exclude NFTs that claim ownership to physical assets, as they do not yet exist). Thus, the ""owner"" of the token is thrice removed from the asset they claim the ownership of.  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that the same goes for artworks, where the ownership lies beyond the artwork itself, but at the [""spirit"" of the art](https://philosophynow.org/issues/108/What_is_Art_and_or_What_is_Beauty) \- which some artists claim to be the essence of art. However, for artworks, the owner has complete access to the artwork. He, she, or they may destroy and/or manipulate it in any way possible. For digital assets, the asset still is public, even if the ownership is private. Thus, purchasing an NFT is purchasing the *concept* of ownership, which is something not yet readily accepted.
&gt; * **Current NFTs to digital ""art"" harms artists**  
&gt; \&gt; You've seen the inundation of supposed art in [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/). Sure there are great ones that are created by genuine artists exploring new mediums of art. However, most ""art"" are simply spams or stolen art (by stolen, I mean works edited/taken without the consent of the original creator) to make quick bucks, [ignoring intellectual and creative rights](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/).  
&gt; \&gt; One might argue that even if so, NFT enables bigger audiences to lesser known artists. Sure, I will not argue against that. However, how much of these lesser known artists are genuine artists and not spammers looking for their lucky strike?
&gt; * **The current NFT landscape is a chicken game**  
&gt; \&gt; We see that massive amounts of art are being traded at [unimaginable prices](https://www.larvalabs.com/cryptopunks/details/7804). There is nothing wrong with that, however, once the game is over, individuals and the media will criticize the ""casino-like"" behavior of NFTs. Sure, people will argue against it and claim that NFT is only the technology and the digital art chicken game is a simple outcome of that, but as we have seen, when DOGE burned individual investors, cryptocurrency and its technology were blamed (the ""guns don't kill people"" argument rarely holds for blockchain tech due to its infancy). Thus, a viable technology will be blamed for its misuse.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; #NFT Pro Argument (Part 1/2)
&gt; 
&gt; Expanding on [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0oyl/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h6ek70r/).
&gt; 
&gt; - *Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them*.
&gt; 
&gt; - **TLDR**: Anyone paying attention this year is aware of NFTs - they have exploded into mainstream consciousness in a way that many of our favorite projects haven't. While some of the crazy valuations indicate a speculative frenzy, as a technology I think NFTs are here to stay because they: (1) are part of a larger interest in developing the '[metaverse](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/style/metaverse-virtual-worlds.html)', (2) increase access and velocity of traditionally illiquid markets, and (3) don't just impact the collectibles space but [extend trustless ownership and verification to a variety of other domains
&gt; ](https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/top-7-nft-use-cases).
&gt; 
&gt; ##NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While much of the attention has centered on NFTs in the ETH ecosystem, there are numerous frameworks for their issuance:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- In addition to the [ERC-721](https://www.binance.vision/glossary/erc-721)/[ERC-1155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155) standards on ETH, NFTs are also supported by [Tezos](https://www.mclaren.com/racing/partners/tezos/), [Flow](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-flow-dapper-labs), [Zilliqa](https://blog.zilliqa.com/polaris-sports-nets-exclusive-nft-deal-featuring-global-football-giants-in-partnership-with-zilliqa-379b99bcdcbd), [Hedera](https://hedera.com/learning/what-is-a-non-fungible-token-nft) and [BSC](https://www.binance.org/en/blog/top-reasons-why-bsc-is-the-best-blockchain-for-nfts/) (BEP-721/ BEP-1155) etc., with [planned integration on Cardano](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/07/22/wolfram-and-cardano-build-communities-with-nfts-and-liveminting/).
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the Kraken Intelligence NFT report](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; ##2021: Year of the NFT
&gt; 
&gt; - While NFTs have [been around since 2014](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/), interest picked up in 2017 with the introduction of [CryptoKitties](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/meet-cryptokitties-the-new-digital-beanie-babies-selling-for-100k.html) and [CryptoPunks](https://mashable.com/article/cryptopunks-ethereum-art-collectibles) on the ETH network.
&gt; 
&gt; - However, the public awareness and resulting demand for NFTs in 2021 absolutely dwarf that early excitement:
&gt; 
&gt; 	- The [NFT market tripled in 2020 to $250M](https://nonfungible.com/subscribe/nft-report-2020), only to quickly be eclipsed by [$2B in sales in Q1 2021](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/13/nft-sales-top-2-billion-in-first-quarter-with-interest-from-newcomers.html). As of Q4 2021, [secondary sales have exceeded $10B](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/masonnystrom/issues/the-multichain-nft-market-798081).
&gt; 
&gt; 	- High profile sales received widespread media attention (e.g. [Christie's auction of an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html)), while the amount of [established brands entering the market](https://decrypt.co/62411/taco-bell-to-charmin-10-big-brands-jumping-on-nft-bandwagon) continue to increase.
&gt; 
&gt; 		- NFTs have penetrated [sports](https://dappradar.com/flow/collectibles/nba-topshot), [gaming](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-spurring-a-digital-land-grabin-videogame-worlds-11616414401), [music](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nfts-are-music-industrys-latest-big-hit-11616491801), [cinema](https://variety.com/2021/film/global/nft-movies-first-film-sale-claude-lanzmann-documentary-1234930343/), [clothing](https://thenextweb.com/news/nike-blockchain-sneakers-cryptokick-patent), [porn](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/crypto-nft-sex-workers-porn-performers-1142030/), and [academia](https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2021/05/28/uc-berkeley-will-auction-nfts-2-nobel-prize-patents).
&gt; 
&gt;         - Some notable NFTs include: [the dictionary definition for NFT](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thanks-to-merriam-webster-you-can-now-own-the-nft-of-the-definition-of-nft-301288201.html), famous memes [(4)](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/29/arts/disaster-girl-meme-nft.html) [(5)](https://blog.originprotocol.com/charlie-bit-my-finger-makes-internet-history-again-1e4a3c54db65), [Reddit avatars](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6ms0b/introducing_cryptosnoosa_very_reddit_take_on_nfts/), [a Picasso painting](https://mashable.com/article/picasso-nft), [a tennis pro's arm](https://decrypt.co/61248/this-tennis-pro-is-auctioning-part-of-her-arm-as-an-nft), [Jack Dorsey's first tweet](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-twitter-dorsey-nft/twitter-boss-jack-dorseys-first-tweet-sold-for-2-9-million-as-an-nft-idUSKBN2BE2KJ) and [Tim Berners-Lee's source code](https://sothebys-com.brightspotcdn.com/94/a2/742444404b45ae855523a58edcd2/www-pr-en.pdf).
&gt; 
&gt;     - With this increase in public attention also came [debate about the environmental impact of NFTs](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change).
&gt; 
&gt; 		- Personally, for the purposes of the Cointest I disregard this narrative as a con argument since it conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains specifically.

CointestAdmin,"#ALGO Pro-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Zarkorix which won 2nd place in the ALGO Pro-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Disclaimer: ALGO is ~15% of my portfolio.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Solving the Blockchain Trilemma
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is a solution to the ""blockchain trilemma"" - the ability of a network to be simultaneously scalable, secure and decentralised. ALGO's TPS is 1k/s, with a 4s finality, 0.001 ALGO transaction fee and it offers L1 smart contracts - however the network will be upgraded in Q3-Q4 2021 to 45k/s TPS and 2.5s finality, ranking it toward the top for speed and scalability [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/120720-Algorand%202021%20Performance.pdf)
&gt; 
&gt; Decentralisation is achieved by the pure PoS (PPoS) consensus mechanism, which employs **algo**rithmic **rand**omness. Unlike delegated PoS (e.g. XTZ, ADA), PPoS does not employ pooled validators, thus minimizing the drive toward centralisation over time that dPOS suffers from. ALGO node running is permissionless - anybody with &gt;1 ALGO can run a node and theoretically participate in consensus. Moreover, the hardware requirements are extremely low - an ALGO node can be run on a low energy, $50 Raspberry Pi.
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of PPoS is the use of a randomised, weighted lottery that selects validators - known as VRF. This prevents any malicious actor(s) from attacking the network since the identities of the currently selected validators (who must be corrupted in order to carry out an attack) are not known until the block is already finalised. At 1-4k validators, PPoS is paradoxically superior to ETH 2.0's 150,000 nodes - because ETH's beacon chains are long-lived. By contrast, ALGO's random selections vary on both a *round* and *subround* basis - that is, block proposers, voters, vote certifiers all vary, across all steps of certifying a block. Unlike ETH 2.0, which makes a single node the 'king-of-the-hill' for a given round (and thus employs slashing to discourage this node from misbehaving), if a node misbehaves in ALGO, it is simply voted against by all other certifiers - no slashing required.
&gt; 
&gt; Governance (launching 1/10/21) will further decentralise the network by placing decisions concerning the network, tokenomics and which projects receive developer grants (see below) into the hands of ALGO holders.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is fast, scalable, secure while remaining decentralised.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Carbon Negative
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand's pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) consensus mechanism is extremely lightweight, consuming \~0.000008 kWh/tx (vs. 0.5479 kWh/tx in ADA - that's \~70,000x less energy, and 116250000x less energy than BTC) - with 4,000 active validators. Minting an NFT requires only 0.0000004 kg of CO2 [(Source).](https://www.algorand.com/resources/blog/sustainable-blockchain-calculating-the-carbon-footprint) This energy usage is 100%+ offset via carbon credits - locked up by an on-chain sustainability oracle, via smart contract, that analyses the energy used by each node. A partnership with ClimateTrade (amongst others) channels this funding into reforestation, peat-management and wind-energy projects at a global level [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/algorand-announcements/carbon_negative_announcement).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is eco-friendly, and the world's first carbon *negative* blockchain network.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Staking Rewards
&gt; 
&gt; ALGO currently offers a seamless staking experience, with an APY of \~5.75% - you simply hold ALGO in a custodial wallet to participate (i.e. you do not need to select a validator and there is no lock-up period). In other words, your ALGO remains liquid at all times. This, however, will be gradually phased out and replaced by Governance, which will increase APY to 7%-30% (depending on the number of participants) but which will require you to vote in every proposal.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Developer Friendly &amp; Ecosystem
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand is extremely accessible to developers [(Source 1)](https://developer.algorand.org/tutorials/) [(Source 2)](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/reference/sdks/): it supports development in Python, C++, GO, Java, Javascript and RUST - removing the need for developers to retrain or learn obscure or new languages (e.g. Haskell). ALGO's smart contract language, TEAL, is incredibly intuitive and can be accessed via Python (PyTEAL). As shown in Source 1, Algorand offers comprehensive and detailed documentation and tutorials (for free) to all prospective developers.
&gt; 
&gt; More importantly, \~$200-250m is available to support developers and 50+ grants have already been issued [(Source)](https://algorand.foundation/developers/developer-incentive-awards-program). In total, \~600-650 companies are currently developing on ALGO and intend to deploy DApps/ALGO-based services [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/).
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO has the ability to instantly attract developers, and is poised for an explosion in its ecosystem.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Academic Rigor
&gt; 
&gt; Algorand was founded by the Turing-award-winning, MIT professor Silvio Micali - and is backed by an excellent team with solid peer-reviewed academic prowess and publication record [(Source 1)](https://www.algorand.com/technology/research-innovation/research-papers) [(Source 2)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;q=silvio+micali&amp;btnG=). Silvio Micali conceived of and pioneered zero-knowledge proofs (among many other protocols) - a key, integral part of ETH 2.0 and the future of cryptography/cryptocurrencies. Such a respectable and trustworthy team boosts ALGO's chances of mass adoption, especially in the financial/institutional sectors.
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO's ability to form partnerships is bolstered by the prestige of its team.
&gt; 
&gt; ## Real World Use
&gt; 
&gt; A key feature of Algorand is that it is *forkless* \- it is mathematically impossible for ALGO to fork [(Source)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030439751930091X). This is extremely important for real-world usage + transactions. Businesses accepting ALGO (unlike 99% of other cryptos) will not only experience rapid finality but can trust that the transaction is not on a forked, branch of the blockchain that can be lost. This also applies to NFTs. Thus far, ALGO has seen major adoption, recently including:
&gt; 
&gt; * 70M South Americans (potentially 200M soon) using ALGO to issue + store COVID-19 passports [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/vitalpass-vaccine-tracing-latam/)
&gt; * BNext adopting ALGO for its $100b/year Spain&lt;-&gt;Latin American remittance service [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/bnext-announces-next-generation-remittance-service/)
&gt; * MAPay adopting ALGO to power $800m/year in healthcare payments for Bermuda [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/resources/ecosystem-announcements/mapay-to-implement-blockchain-based-solutions-on-algorand)
&gt; * SIAE, one of the largest and oldest digital rights managements companies in the world, launched 4.5m NFTs onto ALGO - representing the work of 10,000 artists and which will involve $100m/year in royalties [(Source)](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases/siae).
&gt; * ALGO was recently featured in a World Economic Forum (WEF) report on cryptocurrency - listed as a recommended ""VIP"" blockchain that solves issues with BTC/ETH and proof-of-stake [(Source)](http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Getting_Started_Cryptocurrency_2021.pdf). This document will be seen by institutions, banks and economists worldwide.
&gt; 
&gt; The list goes on and on [Here.](https://www.algorand.com/ecosystem/use-cases)
&gt; 
&gt; **Main Conclusion:** ALGO is already being deployed for large-scale and institutional solutions - despite only launching \~2y ago.

TabletopThirteen,I got SUPER lucky. I was getting tired of playing it safe and only dabbling into new projects. Something clicked with the tokenomics and the idea of NFTs generating the tokens themselves as an investor just made me know this could make it big.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by Jurph which won 2nd place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; A **non-fungible token** is a unique proof-of-ownership concept that ultimately fails to be relevant because of its inability to leap across the digital/physical divide. While it is _possible_ to embed art into a token, or create tokens whose hash is itself the key to generating a piece of art, the vast majority of NFTs are just a receipt. The receipt conveys no meaningful rights, there is no guarantee of scarcity, there is no linkage to tangible goods in the real world, and you are astronomically unlikely to be the beneficiary of the outlandish prices being offered for a minuscule fraction of items in the NFT market. 
&gt; 
&gt; For most NFTs, **purchasing the receipt does not convey any meaningful rights to the media or art**. You own a receipt that says ""the thing at this URL is mine"". The person who has physical or logical control of that server URL decides what, if anything, is hosted at that URL. If they decide it's ""nothing"", then what you own is ""nothing"". If someone buys the domain that your URL points to, that person now decides what gets hosted at your URL. 
&gt; 
&gt; **There is zero guarantee of scarcity.** Nothing prevents any other person from visiting the URL and downloading the thing you ""own"". They can publish it for free, tweet it out, or even mint an NFT of anything, including other NFTs, by simply defining a new NFT standard and making copies of the most popular things on the previous NFT standards. There is nothing about NFTs that makes the digital files ""uncopyable"". If there were, Disney would pay literally whatever it costs to own the license for minting NFTs and you'd have to pay each time you wanted to watch a Marvel movie or look at a picture of Mickey Mouse. Honestly: pray that this remains mathematically impossible. Decades of attempts to invent digital copy protection have largely failed, and NFTs have not moved this needle. 
&gt; 
&gt; For the vast majority of NFTs, **there is no linkage to real tangible goods in any way.** The real-world documents that governments recognize as conferring ownership are separable from NFTs and will ultimately remain separable, because for the foreseeable future a good lawyer will be able to convince a judge that ""all the computer stuff"" is extraneous to the two-party exchange of consideration for value. The few cases where an NFT is tied to a physical good are non-contentious and largely being done as a stunt to boost the publicity of an art auction. 
&gt; 
&gt; And lastly, because of all of these downsides, **inflated NFT prices are almost certain to benefit someone other than you**. The people paying sky-high prices are almost certainly colluding with people who aren't you to drive up the market, or they are using the ""honest public sale"" of these goods as one half of an illicit transaction that you don't see. If you did not pre-arrange to sell the NFT for a very high price, the odds are stacked very much against you selling the NFT for a very high price. Your best likely outcome is that some other poor fool who saw the eye-popping prices has slightly more disposable income than you, and believes your NFT will go up in value.

The Biggest thing is to really look at the tokenomics. I'm not gonna invest in something I don't believe in with 1500% APY with 95% locking rate. But I'll do that all day with a project I believe in like DFK or Defira. With Mars Colony I could see that inflation rate was high early and slows over time. So I knew to keep selling until the price is low and then start upgrading my NFTs. Redding through the white paper and understanding the tokenomics has made me more money than anything.

CointestAdmin,"#NFT Con-Arguments
Below is an argument written by MrMoustacheMan which won 1st place in the NFT Con-Arguments topic for a prior [Cointest](/r/CointestOfficial/wiki/cointest_policy) round.

&gt; Copying from [my previous entry here](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/og0nzx/rcryptocurrency_cointest_general_tech_category/h4r3yvj/):
&gt; 
&gt; Disclaimer: I don't currently hold any NFTs nor have I ever minted or speculated on them
&gt; 
&gt; #NFTs explained
&gt; 
&gt; - One of BTC's original innovations was [digital scarcity](https://policyreview.info/glossary/digital-scarcity). 
&gt; 
&gt; - NFTs inherit this innovation - however, unlike BTC or other cryptocurrencies, NFTs are 'non fungible'. 1 BTC is ([ideally](https://sethsimmons.me/posts/fungibility-graveyard/)) interchangeable for another BTC, but 1 NFT =/= another NFT.
&gt; 
&gt; - As NFTs aren‚Äôt interchangeable with each other, we've seen interest explode over the past year with usecases of proof of authenticity and ownership.
&gt; 
&gt; - For more reading, I'd highly suggest [the NFT report from kraken Intelligence](https://kraken.docsend.com/view/964aiz4n3y5dti3s). 
&gt; 
&gt; #Concerns
&gt; - I'm sure many would consider the cost of minting and transferring NFTs to be a negative - small purchases, sales, and transactions can be costly for users. 
&gt; 
&gt;     - However, this argument is somewhat tied to scalability issues of the Ethereum network in particular, rather than specific to NFTs themselves (which exist on or are planned for other chains, including BSC, Tezos and Cardano). 
&gt; 
&gt;     - For the same reason, I would discount [debate about environmental sustainability](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change), which conflates the environmental impact of NFTs with PoW chains
&gt; 
&gt; - I think more fundamental concerns around NFTs are that - in some cases - they are *not actually so trustless, permanent or scarce*, which undermines their premise and value proposition.
&gt; 
&gt;     - Issues like [phishing, spoofing, deceitful bidding](https://blog.mycrypto.com/common-nft-scams-to-avoid/) etc. are certainly present with NFTs, but also exist in regular cryptocurrency markets - these scams don't undermine the tech or concepts behind NFTs specifically.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - More concerning would be a practice such as [sleepminting on Ethereum](https://timdaub.github.io/2021/04/22/nft-sleepminting-beeple-provenance/), which actually undermines the purported authenticity and scarcity of NFTs:
&gt; 
&gt;         - For example, [Christie's auctioned an NFT by the artist Beeple for $69M](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/11/arts/design/nft-auction-christies-beeple.html) (nice). 
&gt; 
&gt;         * [Monsieur Personne](https://nftheft.com/) then exploited the ERC-721 smart contract to display Beeple as the creator of a copied NFT at the protocol level.
&gt; 
&gt; - [Other smart contract exploits](https://blog.mycrypto.com/nft-smart-contract-bugs-exploits/) have included [brute force attacks to mint rare NFTs](https://iphelix.medium.com/meebit-nft-exploit-analysis-c9417b804f89).
&gt; 
&gt; - Lastly, there's a concern about the permanence and trustlessness of NFTs. An NFT typically points to a URL on the internet or an [IPFS](https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/interplanetary-file-system-ipfs) hash. These then point not to the media itself, but to a JSON file hosted on a company's servers.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;     - [To take Beeple's $69M NFT as an example](https://twitter.com/jonty/status/1372163423446917122?lang=en), its [JSON metadata] (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPAg1mjxcEQPPtqsLoEcauVedaeMH81WXDPvPx3VC5zUz) is hosted by an IPFS gateway run by http://makersplace.com.
&gt; 
&gt;     - So retaining access to this $69M investment depends on a company staying solvent and [keeping their IPFS gateway or centralized server running](https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs).
&gt; 
&gt;     - Here's a [recent example of OpenSea serves going down](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/r5wavu\/opensea_was_down_and_users_have_been_freaking_out/).
&gt; 
&gt;         - There is also a risk of ['link rot'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot)
&gt; 
&gt;         - Or, imagine a scenario in which the gateway operator runs out of capital or even goes bust. Could there be a blackmail situation where a third party scoops up the domain and ransoms access to your NFT assets? 
&gt;  
&gt;     - Worth mentioning that this doesn't apply to all NFTs and some groups are trying to advocate a more permanent storage solution, like [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/).

Let's go back to the real-estate example.  I ""sell"" you my house, by transferring my ""house NFT"" to you.

Then, after money is in hand, I say I did not in fact sell you my *house*, I only sold you an NFT that ""represents"" my house.

You paid for shit- and your only recourse is to go to small claims and plead that a judge recognizes a transfer of an NFT as a contract.  Because there's no enforcement mechanism for any of this, because we do not all in fact agree that an NFT is an ""asset.""

The only people who value NFTs are people who already value NFTs.  No one else- including the law- gives a shit.

Now, **could** that change?  Yeah sure.  It could.  Everyone on earth could have a simultaneous gas leak in their homes, and lose just enough braincells to all agree that NFTs are legally binding.

So what ends up happening in that world, is that an entire enforcement mechanism and all the bureaucracy behind it gets rebuilt to revolve around NFTs instead of paper contracts.

jackinsomniac,"You know what the blockchain is? Basically it's a distributed/decentralized append-only database. Something that's only good for niche use-cases, like a transaction ledger. Normally the blockchain is what keeps track of people's crypto transactions.

An NFT is an entry on the blockchain with a little extra data. For artwork NFTs, this means a URL to an image on an external server somewhere. The image isn't stored on the blockchain, only the link to it is. So if the server goes down, that URL link points to nothing and will 404. This also means anyone with the link to that image can freely download it to their hard drive exactly like any other image on the internet. (It also means if a malicious actor gains control of the server, they can change that image to whatever they want, like a rug, to reference a rug pull.)

Sometimes, some of them actually grant the NFT buyer copyright rights to the art they bought, but this is *EXTREMELY* rare. The majority of them don't.

The best way to describe it is you go to an artwork auction, bid on something, and win. But then they wheel the art piece into the back room. Someone approaches you and hands you a receipt. You ask where the painting is going, and they tell you it's going to a privately-owned museum that's open to the public, for others to see &amp; enjoy. You ask if you now own the painting, and they say no, you own the NFT of the painting. If you finally asked, ""Well what did I just buy then?""

Deep-Yoghurt,"Technically you can do it with renewables but that's more of an ""in theory"" when crypto mining collectively takes up more eneegy than many countries. And PoW is still the biggest by far. And PoS still takes shit tons of energy for something that's useless to society because it's costs more than easier options.

Even if you did somehow switch all mining over to excess renewable energies (which you couldn't in America at least because that would take lawmakers to stop rich people from doing whatever the fuck they want) then it's still extremely wasteful. Pow and PoS both take calculations even if one is way worse thsn the other. On top of that, blockchain tech by design has an extreme amount of redundancy. You're wasting an obscene amount of collective storage space (and thus energy to keep these storages updated, online, and available).

More to a previous point, America (and I would assume many other countries) would need a complete energy grid overhaul so if we did restrict cdypto bros to excess renewable power (which the US has already shown it won't) then the crypto bros will just raise a stink if we try to rework the grid to get that excess energy somewhere it can be used instead.

I'm all for wishfull thinking and new technologies but they have to be feasible and add something of value to society that outweighs its costs. NFTs have given us nothing of value so far but have taken shit loads of unclean energy.

Deep-Yoghurt,"(A) NFT tech is wasteful. Resources are scarce and climate catastrophe is incoming. No reason to speed it for no reason.
(B) NFT tech is harder to manage than direct USD transactions. I don't want ethereum for my nudes; it's volatile and there are gas costs (essentially a third party anyway even if it is less than the OnlyFans' take)
(C) I'm probably gonna have to use 3rd party software anyway because the average person doesn't know shit about minting NFTs or managing wallets. So that's another cost for a third party. On the other hand, if I'm gonna use third party software anyway, OnlyFans probably has a good UX.
(D) If I'm posting it to the blockchain, anyone can see it. So less people are going to bother buying it. It's **access** people want, not **ownership** when it comes to nudes. You can probably sell access instead with smart contracts but that takes a specialized software developer and more advanced users. That costs extra money. And if they screw up slightly, my content might be free or many other bad happenings.
(E) There's no undoes. If someone writes malware into a smart contract and sends it to me, I can lose everything. And if I actually send something to the wrong address, I again lose it even if there is no one using that address. Blockchain only has undoes when rich people lose money (see: ethereum v. ethereum classic)
(F) Similarly, there's no regulation. Onlyfans has customer support, ethereum doesn't (again, for the average person, that is). And if I lose access to my wallet, it's gone. No ""Forgot Password"".
(G) No technology is infallible. Yes, blockchain is more immutable than many other technologies, but even if that was a purely good attribute (see E and F as to why it's not good always), all layers of this cide are written by humans and nothing is perfect.
(H) There are better options. Anyone can start their own website to sell nudes. Way easier to find a web dev to post a simple server than to find a blockchain dev. Yes you would have other costs but minting NFTs, transferring NFTs, and converting to eth also have costs (not to mention all the third parties you'd need unless you're also a tech wiz).

I didn't say anything about PoW getting more efficient, and with ethereum moving to PoS, more could follow. I was more so implying that their might be ways to use less energy to mint, but I'm no programmer.

Perhaps it was a bad comparison, I wasn't looking too deep into it, simply that electric cars went from being not really viable, to widespread use due to technology improving over time. Technology changes fast.

In a real world transaction I would assume terms would be discussed at the time of sale. Perhaps the royalties could be directly paid on the chain to the NFT holders. If you were dealing with dozens of contracts, you may be able to consolidate them easier on the chain. Just because something can be done already without a new solution, doesn't mean that it can't be replaced or coexist with a more efficient or easier solution. 

 I agree, the current state of NFTs is pretty bad, and is definitely a contributing factor to the hate NFTs get, and delaying or destroying the chances of widespread use.

First, PoW doesn't ""get more efficient"". It is inefficient by design and necessity to create scarcity. PoS would get more efficient but still vastly resource inefficient and still greatly favoring the already rich.

Second, it's not a good comparison to electric cars other than how -- similarly to NFTs -- electric cars are a way of avoiding a real solution that would help everyone (financial regulation for NFTs and extensive public transportation for EVs) in exhange for ""cars, but new"".

Third, I talked about the music thing. And your solution could be done already with real contracts. NFTs boast about their immutable contracts but most contracts change over time as artists and companies/individuals change what they want and renegotiate. Contracts shouldn't be immutable or automatic. And all NFTs do is add a middle man.

Flauros32,"My initial goal was only to inform people that NFTs aren't just confined to shitty jpegs, and I just used that thread as an example. Perhaps you could reply on twitter, since I feel it's beyond my scope to comment on some of this. The way I feel about NFTs or new technology in general, is it they can do it better or more efficient than their traditional counterparts, then they might be implemented. If people can't come up with ways to make it work, then it will fail. Only time will tell.

I will try to address a few things though. Take electric cars for example, they weren't efficient enough to use when first invented, but the technology has come a long way, and now countries are committing to switching to them over time. That's how I see new technology like NFTs, if people are actively developing, it hopefully should become more efficient over time.

As for NFT songs, I think it could be a good idea. An independent artist trying to raise funds for an album might make a single into NFTs where the holders get x% of royalties on that song. A bit contrary to what the Twitter user said, you could still post it on Apple, Spotify etc, but now they might rely less on getting paid by Apple and Spotify, and they might have already raised the funds for their album. If the song takes off, the NFT buyers are happy in the long run.

PiddlyD,"Right - but if a digital downloaded included an encrypted marker blockchain marker that  verified OWNERSHIP of that digital instance, along with the conferred right to transfer the ownership of that blockchain marker to a different entity...   


  
Now, an intangible digital asset is \*tangible\*. This is the other thing I don't think people understand about NFTs.   


Right now, if I am an artist and I create a physical object, a painting... a... let's use a BIRDHOUSE... if I create that object and sell it to you - it is YOURS. I'm still the artist, still the creator. I can make one just like it - and I can prevent you from duplicating it. I didn't sell you the rights to recreate and distribute my art - I sold you a piece of my art that you can then resell to someone else if you want.   


But if I create you a CGI birdhouse for your virtual property - you really own \*nothing\* except the legal right to put that CGI birdhouse on that property (within the limits of the license I grant you when you purchase the CGI birdhouse). While I can litigate if someone else takes copies of that CGI birdhouse and sells them - it is difficult and expensive to establish that I created it, that I have IP rights to it, and that you stole it - and nearly \*impossible\* to practically STOP either the individual by flooding the market with copies of my digital birdhouse, available for free - or for me to stop some company from reselling copies of my digital birdhouse for payment.   


NTFs change all that. It makes it so that the digital birdhouse I sell you cannot be copied and installed in your virtual playground - it can be SOLD to someone else so that they can install it in theirs, but the original purchaser has to virtually transfer everything about the digital birdhouse to the new owner. A company could buy it and resell it - but the same thing would apply. Someone else could make you a birdhouse, with an NTF, that is LIKE mine... but it would be verifiably not a PiddlyD Studios Birdhouse - and therefore, as authentic as a fake Rolex. Branding starts to have \*meaning\* with NTFs. Authenticity has \*meaning\* with NTFs.   


This is why NTFs are \*important\* for the development of a virtual digital economy.   


It may not be perfect - but it is the first step toward meaningful transfer of digital content. Until there is a secondary market for authentic ORIGINAL digital content - digital content WON'T be as tangible as REAL content.

gotsreich,"They aren't literally the same thing but there's enough overlap that you can replace a lot of current DRM with NFTs. OP is just ignorant of what NFTs actually are. They're very confident though.

A NFT is a ""non-fungible token"" which just means that it's a token that has its own unique existence.For example, a dollar is fungible because every dollar is equivalent so you can replace one dollar with another. A land deed is non-fungible because one plot of land is not just like another.

For instance, you can buy a song from Amazon Music (not that you should). That lets you download or stream it to their app. Concretely, you're paying for them to add a database entry. A blockchain is at its heart just a database. So you could instead buy a NFT of the song. They'll query the blockchain to see if you own the appropriate NFT just like they do now with their internal database.

They don't have a reason to do this unless customers demand it though. Blockchains are bad databases but have the advantage that they're public.

FaceDeer,"Yeah, systems like ENS do enforce uniqueness. It's just not something that's *inherent* in NFTs as a general class, because NFTs as a general class are hugely broad in their potential applications. Most uses I can think of would require uniqueness, though, so I imagine most would have that built into them as a matter of course.

The main trick with making NFTs inherently useful is enforcing the mechanism for how they translate into real-world effects. This is /r/piracy, I'm sure everyone here rightfully scoffs at the notion of DRM. A lot of people think NFTs for digital images are some kind of DRM, somehow, and are upset when people continue freely distributing the image that the NFT represents. The two situations where NFTs will really shine are ones where they can have some kind of *legal* enforcement, and the ones where they have some kind of *technical* enforcement.

Replacing paper vehicle titles would require the legal system to recognize the NFT as an authoritative means of asserting ownership over a vehicle, for example. If there's no legal recognition then I can sell you the NFT for my car, then report it as stolen when you drive away with it and you're the one who's in trouble (well, probably a judge would side with you in court if it was *that* blatant a rip-off, but you get the basic gist). More relevant to the current NFT craze, you could use the NFT as a way to license a copyright to whoever holds it. This is a field that's going to be slow to develop and probably quite messy.

The technically-enforced stuff is more interesting in the short term, but harder to pull off without ending up relying on some kind of centralized server. There could be an MMORPG, for example, that represents virtual ""land"" or in-game items as NFTs and allows them to be bought and sold. Or a digital trading card game like Magic the Gathering where the cards are NFTs, so there's limited numbers of each type out there in circulation. But ultimately it depends on the game servers recognizing those NFTs as an authority. It's a step in the right direction but there's still a higher authority that can take your NFT-represented ""property"" away from you without recompense.

The best cases are things like ENS where the NFT inherently enforces all of the uses that you might actually want to put it to, by its nature. That's pretty challenging to pull off in most use cases though.

Personally, I'm happy to see the whole spectrum of applications being worked on. As long as everyone who's buying or selling an NFT knows what that NFT actually represents and doesn't think it gives them more than what it actually does, it's fine.",hpvi4gy,t1_hpvdwf5,/r/Piracy/comments/rnlx13/yep_you_totally_own_that_movie_you_just_bought/hpvi4gy/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,0,,,

Of an address. Not anything real. If you buy an NFT of a piece of art, you don't actually own that art (99% of the time) and can't do anything with it but sell that NFT. I haven't really seen where it becomes your artwork and you can license it and sue the creator for using it etc.

Koldsaur,"Do you know anything about blockchains and how they work? When people trade cryptocurrencies, it makes a transactional handshake that gets permanently hard coded into that crypto's Blockchain. The way that crypto works in a nutshell is every computer that is mining the crypto and that makes a transaction, helps contribute to solving that crypto's impossible code sequence, which is what makes all crypto's secure and anonymous. Because the transactions are traceable as they were recorded, but not assigned to an individual in any other way other than a login that only they know, allowing it to be anonymous. 

NFTs are awful for the environment because they get encoded *IN* a crypto's Blockchain, encouraging for more people to invest in them and in cryptos in general.

Using NFTs to assign ownership, would mean you could buy/sell digital games, media, goods and actually transfer ownership. I.e. the license is transferred, you can no longer use that media but the person who bought it can.

Ubisoft could 100% remove the specific NFT that someone bought. But it would be much more convoluted than the current system.

&amp;#x200B;

These NFTs are public resalable items that are tied to wallets, not game accounts. Simply sending the NFT to a different wallet is all it would take for your cosmetic item to be used on a different account. Ubisoft could blacklist that specific NFT if they wanted to. But its a hell of a lot of extra steps. These items have a scarcity to them. For Ubisoft to ban one of these itmes affects the actual price of the rest of those cosmetics. They can always mint another (if their smart contract allows them to. This is another plus of blockchain. Its not about the company, its about the code written into a smart contract. That decides how these things function.) to replace that blacklisted NFT. But thats a giant waste of time and code.

&amp;#x200B;

Sure Ubisoft can be dicks and go through a shitload of extra effort to make that a feature (boy would that be EVEN more bad press for them). But Ubisoft is not the only company using blockchain tech. Many companies advertise this as a feature that non nft games can't compete with at the current moment. In fact, this is quite important to things like CCG games. If I buy Magic: The Gathering cards, I own those for life. If I buy a Hearthstone card pack, Blizzard can take away my account - and my investment - for things as simple as inactivity. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a result, CCG card games like Splinterland's and Gods Unchained fix a problem that was created by taking card games digital. Other game genres can and will use this as well of course.",hp1jyyl,t1_hp1grr3,/r/Piracy/comments/rj3fui/ubisoft_deletes_customers_account_with_paid_games/hp1jyyl/,1,Piracy,t5_2qmox,r/Piracy,0,,,

The downside is that scanning high-quality art requires a scanner that can handle large formats and access to expensive art. For a decent looking print at 300dpi, you need at least 1728x2592 for a 24x36 poster - but over 4000 pixels to a side is better. At that minimum, it will look like ass up close - think pointilism where none is intended.

If you don't mind older stuff though:

* [https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en) \- this is a Dutch museum that has been making more and more of their collection available in high enough resolutions to do large format posters. They're even willing to honour requests for high resolution scans of objects in their collection - and they make those available as colour-corrected TIFFs.
* [https://www.audubon.org/birds-of-america](https://www.audubon.org/birds-of-america) The Audubon Society had a folio printed in the 1800s of beautiful paintings of birds. The book is ultra-rare because of its physical size (it's something crazy like 2 feet by 4 feet?) and the fact that the prints were had finished in each version. I've printed a number of these out at local printers in 16x20 and they look absolutely gorgeous without being tacky.
* The NFTBay might be able to oblige - some talented artists do NFTs for a quick buck, and the ""purchase"" often links to a very high-res version.

* Extremely well established music artists demanding like ¬£15 for ONE CD (looking at you TDCC)??? ~~Any film-~~ **ANY industry that says I'm only buying a ""license"" to view content and not the actual physical thing I bought?** Fuck you. Done. 
* Music available on youtube topic channels? A quick `youtube-dl -f140 -x &lt;url&gt;` and I've now got the song as m4a. Done. 
* Stupid fucking DRM implementations? Pirating is easier. 
* TV licensing? ppfffffffffttttttt
* Any sort of streaming service where what I want could disappear without notice because I dont have a physical copy or backed up copy on my collection? Done.
* NFTs? Fuck you and fuck everything about NFTs. Proud right clicker. (This server-space isn't going to fill itself right?)
* Research papers hidden behind a publisher? Fuck you. I'm going to the researchers themselves and almost all of the time, they'll give them for free and are often happy to do so. 

Stuff I dont pirate? 

* Steam games and some on itch. Its just easier. 
* Also audio books, I'd buy the CDs, rip them and then add to the collection. Also another reason to go out :-) 
* Open source efforts. Although yeah you don't have to pay for them, I always like donating a small bit to help.
* Bands I really like and want to support. Again I dont have to, most of them have youtube topic channels and I could easily just use youtube-dl if I'm having a hard time....

logicalpsycho,"Having a validated creator makes something scarce. As long as the creator made a limited number of a thing, that thing has more value than something counterfeit - even if it's an exact copy.

Switching examples: let's say Nike starts doing NFT sneakers that you can wear in Fortnite. If someone clicks on your character, it shows that your shoes are part of a limited Nike release, with Nike as the confirmed creator. Some character standing next to you has the perfect counterfeit copy, but when people click on their character, the creator of the sneakers comes up as shit_lord69 or something like that.

In this example, the avatar with the official Nike sneakers has more clout in-game than the person with the counterfeit. The person with the counterfeit sneakers might get made fun of, or maybe Fortnite might implement a system where you can't even import an NFT from an unknown/unverified creator.

You personally might think NFTs are dumb as shit, and paying money for gaming skins is dumb as shit, but you can bet your bottom dollar there are plenty of kids that will pay $10 for the Nike shoes and wouldn't ever get caught wearing some counterfeit, unverified duplicates.

As food for thought, extending the example a little further: what if owning the Nike NFT gives you access to Nikeland in Fortnite, with exclusive access to a Drake concert in-game. What if it also gives you early buyer access to real-life physical Nike shoes in the future?

If you‚Äôre buying a Ken Griffey card, you make sure it‚Äôs authenticated first, ie you know Upper Deck made it on X date, it‚Äôs one of 10k made, these three people had it before you, it sold at these prices, etc.

Zanion,"To get a painter requires finding/commissioning an artist of sufficient skill. You incur risk too, that it may not be well done and you would need to start over. Maybe the paints the forger uses aren't the same composition. The strokes themselves are essentially guaranteed to not be the same. There is also the temperature, environment, or the million other parameters that would make a replica painting non identical to some degree. All of this is expensive too of course, in both time and money. So the original, is always the original and cannot be exactly replicated and approximating a functionally identical copy is expensive.

Assume instead anyone can have an exact replica of that painting, created practically instantly, for free and at-will. These properties are importantly what separates digital art from physical art fundamentally. It's also what makes this explanation akin to comparing apples to oranges. I'm not convinced that explanation serves to aid understanding NFTs very well at all.

Nearest I can tell, NFTs serve as a glorified notary. So, maybe using them against physical assets like we use a paper deed for a house makes sense, even as a deed of ownership for art makes sense. Assuming there are proper real-world processes working in tandem with the tech and enforcing the mapping of physical assets to digital record. This makes sense because houses and physical artwork have well understood and enforceable ownership properties. Using NFTs as proof of ownership of digital art where the very concept of ownership isn't even clear or enforceable, doesn't make a lot of sense.

Maybe NFT tech could back some sort of digital licensing technology, not clear to me if that would be a meaningful improvement on existing licensing solutions.

It leverages the same ""public-ledger"" system that powers most cryptocurrencies, and essentially allows artists to insert their signature on digital art, much like how an artist working on physical materials can sign theirs to ensure it is an original.

It's wildly overused and abused at the moment, and I expect a crash before too long, but I can absolutely see an interpretation of NFTs that actually makes sense.

Reynbou,"Of course it's legal if you know how NFTs work.

Buying an NFT isn't buying the artwork. Selling an NFT isn't selling the artwork. 

An NFT is spending money for someone to send you a link. You don't own the link, you don't own the art the link is to. You just have access to the link.

They could shut down the server that the link points to and it would make no difference. You still got the link, and that's what you paid for. You paid for someone to give you a link. The link doesn't have to work.

That's what an NFT is. And that's why NFTs are a scam.",i3f67b0,t1_i3cieum,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/tvvdl8/giant_ass_on_rplace_removed_by_moderators/i3f67b0/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

Ogimouse1,"And while I am sensitive to that idea, I hate that this ""experiment"" on what this site js supposed to represent is apparently engendered in *everythinghas ro be a fight and someone will put no-no squares, racism, and drugs into every, little, f###ing thing*.

This is also where I'm saying Reddit is self-cucking RE revenue.  

I would have loved to see how the weird Jerma scary canvas got on.  I probably would have even watched one of his videos of my own volition to get some context.   I would have loved to see what Canada could have come up with if people weren't f###ing them.  I would have loved to see what other memorials or whatever would have been backdrooped onto the US flag.  That UK flag was a piece of art.  The ships and the meeting hall and so many things like using AmongUs as shading were absolutely üíØ 

I hated each and every reference to Star Wars.  I hate the franchise and all it does is rile me up.  I don't want to see the no-no squares.  I don't want to see 8 feet of German flag fighting for dominance over 8 feet of trans flag.  I don't want to see the tribalism overtake the idea of shared community. 

Hear me out: Reddit should monetize the canvas. 

r/Place could continue to be the community-at-large *but* accounts have to have skin in the game by giving *at least* their free award for the period.  So, maybe make the canvas every quarter or something, and only accounts that have existed for at least 2 weeks, have X amount of *positive* karma, and have given at least their free award 1 out of the 3 months can participate.  The size of the canvas would depend on the number of awards collected from *active, still existing, eligible-to-participate* accounts.  I'll even go all-in and say if you give an award for whatever amount after it's started, you can get a time bonus for a short period of time (so, like, if you give the canvas a silver-level you can reduce it from 5 minutes to 4 minutes for an hour, or if you gice a 500 coin you can go from 5 minutes to 1 minute for an hour).  If you're a premium member already, you already get a discount on awards so no additional boosts except, maybe, a free 1-hour boost at gold level or something.  IDK, that's for the nerds to work out.  Imagine how much that would:
A) Slow down and reduce the overall number of bots;
B) Give people a chance to release excess frustration that it isn't done more often, thereby releasing that tension;
C) Raise revenue for Reddit by incentivizing the purchase of coins and premium whatever status, including friends gifting premium to each other;
D) Make people consider seriously what they're doing *ahead of time* so they can plan; and
E) Actually make it a community effort where the infighting is not necessarily based on being as violent and offensive as possible.  And this last point is the one I care about the most.  If the *only* reason you're putting a p##n on Donald Duck is to get people upset, you're just being an a##--and if that's what you want to do, you should have to pay for that privilege. 

Subs already can get perks for boosts or whatever.  Imagine a canvas in individual subs.  Star Wars can go buck wild when there are enough awards unlock the sub's individual canvass for the quarter and no one us going to screw with them.  NSFW subs can have all the a##, p##n, b###, v##, etc. they want.  Hell, imagine what the canvasses for any video games would look like. It would help:
A) Increase traffic in subs so that people can get their positive karma;
B) Better identify bots;
C) Incentivize boosting subs;
D) Raise revenue by incentivizing buying awards and premium memberships in between events--especially if the events are staggered--like r/Place is March, June, September, December then individual subs are February, May, August, and November;
E) Reduce the number of super-mods because of the time and attention needed to actually do their jobs (especially if it's true they're getting ready to be paid in NFTs issued by Reddit).  

For clarity, I consider anything involving a non-human acting because of some program or script a bot.  If you're legitimately accessing 300 accounts every 5 minutes, you're not going to be doing it for long.  But anyone complaining about the heavy hands of the mods and admins doing that are not on a moral high ground to complain that they should be allowed to steam roll over people based on their non-community-minded based on their *own* subjective feelings.  That's the kind of thing that you don't get to complain about: using a completely unstated, arbitrary distinction to hammer on someone else in a malicious way because you feel victimized by an arbitrary TOS enforcement.",i3ea4ix,t1_i3dk99g,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/tvvdl8/giant_ass_on_rplace_removed_by_moderators/i3ea4ix/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

MultiMarcus,"You are certainly correct in the sense that developers/publishers aren‚Äôt innocent when taking the Epic money, but in my mind it works like bribery. Both the briber and bribed are guilty. Not that I see a contract of exclusivity as bribery, but guilt wise they are similar. 

I don‚Äôt think we would excuse any other platform launching like it is the early 2000s when modern stores are of a higher standard. Uplay and Origin are terrible, but those are at least just a company‚Äôs attempt at creating their own launcher. They aren‚Äôt trying to play the role of main store for people. 

Steam definitely needs competition, but for me and many other PC gamers, it is specifically the exclusivity that we have problems with. That and NFTs. No one said they can‚Äôt make games cheaper, have better sales, give out free games, have better cuts, or make the browsing experience better than Steams. You can compete for customers in ways that benefit the customer like the things I mentioned or things that demonstrably hurt the customer, even if only a small amount, like for example having exclusive games. That doesn‚Äôt give you more games, but rather takes away games from another platform. 

It is odd to see you against Origin and Uplay when those are demonstrably better for developers and give the company 100% of the profit and then a sentence earlier support Epic for giving more profit to the company. Could you explain your reasoning there?

The extreme hate is certainly unjustifiable, but disliking Epic is more than possible and as much as free games are nice, I don‚Äôt think they need to do exclusivity. Make the store Steam level or better before you start pouring money into exclusivity deals. I am also quite economically stable, so I don‚Äôt care much for free games or better sales, but I understand why that would matter to a lot of people.",i2l42ot,t1_i2l0jyv,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/tr1rzy/epic_games_is_now_the_biggest_corporate_donor_to/i2l42ot/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

WillDeletOneDay,"&gt;His treatment of talent is also well known to be horrendous

Worst I've seen recently is that he forces employees to use their vacation time and he was yelling at Luke for answering emails on his day off. I went searching for info on wtf you're talking about but I can't find anything. His employees have openly and casually mocked some of self-admitted control freak tendencies, but that's about it.

He specifically is not relocating his headquarters despite how insanely expensive it is to be in Vancouver because he doesn't want to force his employees and their families to relocate.

&gt;he thinks that employees should straight up he barred from using social media without their employers permission.

New employees have a probationary period where they can't appear on videos and aren't mentioned by name. You could argue that that is weird, but I don't exactly know *why* this is a rule.

&gt;He's also heavily invested in crypto and i believe even NFTs.

This right here is bull. He briefly considered starting a coin until he realized there was no legitimate use for one. and his stance on NFTs has been fluctuating a lot, but it generally seems like his stance is that they aren't inherently bad, but have a lot of potential for abuse.

&gt;He's come out against unions before on Twitter.

All I can find on Linus' stance on Unions is this:

* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpyiNOD-MOk
* https://twitter.com/linustech/status/1155899393620336640

I'm generally pro union, but I can agree with the statement that unions aren't a flawless thing with no problems. His example of a useless fucking teacher that is unfireable is something I also have personal experience with. Many teachers' unions protect tenured teachers while doing almost nothing to protect younger teachers. A bad union can definitely be worse than no union, but that doesn't mean unions shouldn't exist.

His Twitter stance against a YouTuber Union honestly just totally lacks any nuance. I see zero explanation for why he feels the way he does, but it's clear to me that he sees no benefit in a union in this very specific context. While unionization is generally good for workers, there are definitely some places where unions don't make any sense, the biggest example is police unions.

Overall it seems like he's not firmly on either side of the fence in regard to unions.",hx4xq4i,t1_hx4uisa,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/srzo17/developer_of_stress_testing_software_occt_posts_a/hx4xq4i/,14,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,,0,,,

Under ENS there's no authoritative server, you can administer your domain by issuing transactions through any Ethereum node.

[There are plenty of ways that DNS can be attacked](https://www.infoblox.com/dns-security-resource-center/dns-security-faq/what-are-dns-attacks/). [Major DNS outages happen](https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/22/a-dns-outage-just-took-down-a-good-chunk-of-the-internet/) despite whatever decentralization is built into DNS' protocol. An ENS name can't go down without the entire Ethereum blockchain state being inaccessible and it is simply not susceptible to most of the forms of attack described here.

Nothing prevents you from overloading the host associated with the record, it has nothing to do with ENS. I'm not sure why you would think it was, this is like objecting to building a house with a steel frame instead of a wooden one because you can still shoot the homeowner when they answer the door.

Anyway, I'm not trying to ""sell"" you on ENS or convince you to use it. I'm presenting it as an example of a NFT-based system that serves a technical purpose.

The issue with minting/creating NFTs is that you have to have a unique piece of media attached to each spot on the ledger.  Hand-crafting a different piece of artwork, even something as simple as a JPEG, is out of the question - we're talking about thousands and *thousands* of JPEGs.

There's two ways to circumvent this.  The first is to have a backlog of media assets you can already use.  That's why you hear about a company like Konami ""selling Castlevania assets"" as NFTs.  They already have, all of the original sprites for the games, so they don't need to put any effort or resources into creating anything new.  That has the added benefit of brand recognition: don't you want to ""own"" the original sprite of Dracula?

The second way is to procedurally generate your images.  Let's say you're wanting to sell ten thousand NFTs - that means ten thousand spots on your ledger, or ten thousand spots in the imaginary line I mentioned earlier.  Each spot is assigned a numerical value, from 0000 to 9999, so we don't have any repeated numbers.  The number on that particular ledger is the actual NFT that you're selling, but you need the image to go along with it, because people like to feel that they've bought something tangible.  You have a basic template image - let's say a stick figure - and four variations: the stick figure's hat, the color of the background, the small object they're holding in their hand, and the border of the image.  You create ten different variations for each of them - ten different hats, ten different borders, etc - and assign each variation a number from 0 to 9.  Somebody buys the NFT for 4360, it means they get the image with the exact variations assigned to those numbers in those spots: hat #4, background #3, object #6, border #0.  The fact that it means that every NFT looks cheap, mass-produced, and ugly doesn't really matter - what matters is that each one is, technically speaking, completely unique from the rest.",hus6fp1,t1_hus29zd,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/sfoenm/a_article_about_how_to_block_everyone_who_uses/hus6fp1/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

2. They think the price of the NFT will keep going up eternally and they will be able to sell it to someone else for even more.

3. There are sometimes vague ideas that the money sent to the initial minters of the NFT's will be used to make some sort of actually financially viable property like a game or animation based on the art of NFTs which will then have money trickle down.

Yep, and thus the way to get any value out of the money you spent on your spot in the line amongst all the other spots and all the other lines is to loudly yell that YOUR spot is super super special and that everyone else will want it. Which explains why you hear so much about NFTs - everyone who's trying to sell their spot is trying to yell as loudly at they can to attract as much attention as they can.

The blockchain technology crypto is built on is horribly inefficient and ineffective, most of the problems it ""solves"" are ones unique to the technology itself, and most of the proposed future implementations are things it would actually be terrible at. The tech bros who created it are either so egotistical they can't perceive of a world where they can't solve problems with code, because they understand one complicated thing and so assume all other things must somehow be less complicated, or they realize they can't solve problems with code and instead just say shit to push the grift forward. Crypto and NFTs are going to be a problem for the rest of us, because even if we don't buy into the grift the people behind it are well-connected enough that they might force their hypercapitalist ideals and systems onto us anyway.

Also because its a blockchain (think of big excel sheet where you can only add rows to change data), you're ""coins""/""NFTs"" only exist on the blockchain. People have digital ""keys"" that let them look at what they own on the chain and let them interact with the blockchain to move assets around to others. So what Flocka was looking in those videos was a website that used his ""look at what I own""-key and showed him all the NFTs he had. But, as cryptobros are so proud of, NFTs (which are just digital tokens) can have code attached to them, called ""smart contracts"". So Flocka didn't know those NFTs someone sent him had this code attached, and once he tried to interact with them they activated to transfer money to another adress. And because code is the only verifying factor of any crypto technology, as long as the rules of the code were followed the transaction is valid.

ELI5: Think of the NFTs that were sent to flocka like paintings. Someone sent Flocka three paintings which were just delivered straight into his home. When he unpacked these paintings, he saw they had a QR code on them, which he scanned on his phone.

R_Sholes,"&gt; Your information wont be public, the information is private. The FACT that the medical passport is OWNED by you is public. Whats in it is not. You have to give permission for people to access. 

If the information is stored on some private servers, they can verify the access. They still can (and should) encrypt it. That's orthogonal to the blockchain.

The potential hack wouldn't involve ""changing all the information on all the nodes"", it would involve leaking your private keys (accidentally or in a hack) and giving everyone access to read and write your records.

If it's on a public blockchain, you can't just send a note and revoke the key - someone would just need to share a few hundred bytes to keep all your records accessible forever. They could even upload the leak to a blockchain, for extra layer of irony.

&gt; Right now you DONT. The idea is that with ssid, blockchain and nfts. You WILL. Not that it currently is. It WONT be some private database. If its implemented it will be accepted by everyone. THATS the idea.

Who verifies that you're actually the one you claim to be? How do you revoke it? How do you ensure that sites you've granted access to your data actually delete it once you're done?

&gt; The asset would technically be decentralized. Meaning there‚Äôs no central database that contains which asset belongs to who. Its a blockchain. Everyone in the ecosystem will make up the database collectively. Making it secure. Thats what blockchain is

Your Steam inventory is pretty secure already. Even more secure, because if you lose or leak your password, you can write to their support and recover your inventory even if the hacker moved it already.

Freely sharing assets between games often mentioned in relation to this is a poorly thought out pipe dream - even if you'd manage to get to an agreement on file formats and such, why would other players want to see your, I dunno, Homer Simpson with an AK-47 in Elder Scrolls Online? And that's even before getting into actual mechanics and balance.

The only realistic purported use is selling, and more gambling and monetization is *exactly* what we need in games.

Bizzaro_Murphy,"&gt; NFT tickets can be inscribed with exclusive art for say a kanye west concert. Which could then mean it could be worth something as its an exclusive collectors item from a once in a life time kanye west concert. 

If people wanted this it could have been done without NFTs. Everyone could recieve an exclusive piece of artwork when they enter the concert but they don't because people are paying for the concert experience - NOT to own an exclusive piece of art. 

&gt; Thanks to smart contracts, any revenue you gain from selling the ticket to collectors can automatically pay the workers involved in the event. The security, the artist, the light guy, the cleaning guy, whatever. No middle man, just instant. You get a slice of the pie too of course. 

Why on earth would the ticket seller agree to this setup? The current setup benefits them much more. If the answer is that ""workers could unite and demand this new setup"", then why do they need NFTs to accomplish this? All of these ""features"" can be written into a union contract. 

&gt; Thanks to the blockchain, companies can monitor the tickets (well, anyone can) and prevent scalping, fraudulent exchanges. Also thanks to the blockchain, people can very easily verify if a ticket is legit or not. 

The ticketing venue can already verify whether a ticket is legit or not - if they wanted to expose this functionality to the public they could - again no NFTs needed.

&gt; what do you mean your health information is public? Why would it be public? Your medical passport's ownership will be public, people can see it belongs to you and you can verify that this medical passport is yours. People cant access the information within without YOUR permission, that's the plan at least. 

As long as the underlying data (in this case the actual health data) is separate from the blockchain, there is no way to guarantee the relationship between this NFT/blockchain ""token"" is correct. It would require a third party to manage the mapping of the blockchain token to the actual data for that token - in which case why not just drop the NFT/blockchain part altogether.

&gt; I dont know why you imply that its not secure having information on the blockchain. Blockchain is very secure to hacking. If people change information on one computer, it wont reflect on other computers within the blockchain. People can cross reference and know something's off. 

People can cross reference data ON the blockchain - if at anytime something external to the blockchain comes into play - e.g. the health passport data - there needs to be an arbiter to correlate these - usually a government agency. If you need this arbiter anyway, again why bother with the whole NFT/blockchain thing.

&gt; NFTs in healthcare has potential where your medical records can be updated and shared between you and medical personnels anywhere in the world. You can receive updates instantly, close communication loops and doctors can follow up with your case fairly quickly compared to traditional hospital communication. Why NFTs and blockchain? well why not? why invent a new thing when the technology already exists. Its universal, it already exists, the technology is secure and efficient as is. 

Same response - you either put the data itself on the blockchain (nobody wants their health data on a public blockchain) or you have a third-party who correlates the blockchain token to the underlying data in which case why bother with a blockchain.

&gt; Self sovereign identity. Control over who you are online. Being able to verify who you are and verify your credentials and widely accepted across all corners of the digital world. Your identity is not controlled by the government or any other third parties. Any data of us online is owned by us and anyone who wants to get their hands on it need our permission. 

Identity verification doesn't require a blockchain and once again you have the problem of either all of your data is on the blockchain, or a third party arbiter translates your token to actual data in which case why have a blockchain.

&gt; wrong, traditional transactions arent secure and transparent. People can own their in game items and sell and buy them for real money with blockchain and NFTs safely and efficiently.

Why would a company providing DLCs agree to this transparency? If it was due to consumer demand, they could simply expose their existing databases - no blockchain needed.",hr4gze4,t1_hr408a7,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr4gze4/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

Yes, and I have always talked about the same.

Allahambra21,"&gt;Bruh, this you?

You're gonna have to be specific. 

I've said that they bundle the license with the token/art, and that the license is intrinsically linked. 

Never said the token actually *contain* the license. (although, I have noted that a license could be contained within either the smart contract or the blockchain itself. But BAYC hasnt done either)

Again either you're reading different things into my words or you're doing your best missinterpreting what I've written. 

&gt;Why are you constantly flip-flopping between what is and what could be?

Genuinely just curious now but are you unable to parse the difference between a hypothetical and a practical example?

BAYC is only part of the conversation because it was the inital project brought up. 

This discussion and the points I've been making all along arent dependent on BAYC. 

Its just that you somehow have drawn the conclusion that if you can find examples of BAYC failing in one instance then that somehow also means NFTs as a whole has failed in that same instance. 

I brought up BAYC because that was the topic of discussion and to prove the initial principle, And then I moved on to NFTs as a conceptual technology which has enabling aspects even if BAYC specifically fail to utilise them. 

I've never ""flipp flopped"" between them, I was having a conversation about NFTs as a technology with BAYC as the conversational onramp, and moved on when they no longer served as a relevant example. 

For some reason you continuously bring it back to the specifics of the BAYC license agreement as if that is somehow a core point of contention in a discussion about NFTs as a whole. 

This is just basic reading comprehension. 

I moved on from BAYC long ago and only include them to answer your specific questions about them. Its you that are still bring them up. Ask yourself why, not me. 

&gt;Is that ""charitably engaging in the actual discussion""?

Friend like 5 comments ago you told me to ""fuck off with that bad faith etc etc etc"" and have several times now implied or outright stated that I cant possible be educated in law because I'm not speaking eloquently enough and am drawing different legal conclusions than you. 

You dont think the point of ""good faith discussion"" sailed a while ago?

&gt;So you know this license would get you smacked if you'd try to present it in a class, not even speaking about your legal department, and you call that ""looked into BAYC""?

&gt;Actual legal departments are anal about even more carefully worded licenses, and you claim that they'll just wave through your ""no worries bro, it's on blockchain, and it says you Own The Art elsewhere""?

No offence, and genuinely, I now dont even know what you're talking about. 

As I've said, an agreement cant be written on a napkin and still have legal effect. 

Do you think that that means my agreement law professor would accept it if I submitted a napkin?

I am and have always talked about the **actual** legal implications. Not whether it holds to some kind of professional standard. 

A license agreement could be the most impeccably written work ever concieved and authored by the most expert of experts in license agreements, and if it was written on top of a napkin or somehow tied to an NFT it would still be fully rejected both by all my professors and every place I've ever worked or interned at. 

But none of that matters to whether and what legal effect the napkin license would have. 

This is the first time I'll say this to you because it hasnt been the case previously, but you are simply moving the goalposts now. 

I've never claimed that the BAYC license is impeccable or even great. Its absolutely piss poor. 

But its still a license agreement, its still linked to the art and the tokens, and it still has legal effect. 

Yes I would have failed if I submitted it in class but if presented in court it would still be held up as a legitimate agreement. And like it or not thats all that matters. 

&gt;Mate, you still didn't show how licenses are ""tied"" to NFTs - you'd have to show that before it could be even tried in court.

Do you want me to link the snippet from the license again?

*Thats* how its linked in the BAYC case specifically. 

Other projects could do it even better by natively storing the license on chain and therefore not relying on website hosting for its license, but legal effect wise it doesnt make a difference as long as the website is up (or cached). 

&gt;You can't even do that for the example you've brought up yourself (which is now bad and imperfect. I'm sure you looked it up reeeeal good when you first brought it up, surely, and just couldn't find a better example, for reasons).

Again, I've not looked up a single other NFT project and only looked up this one because I was curious. 

Again, you seem to be projecting all your made up stereotypes about crypto and NFT bros onto me just because I dared to suggest that there may be a slight sliver of benefit to NFTs that I noticed while looking this project up out of curiousity. 

For all I know BAYC is simply the best in this regard. 

Or there are plenty others that are better. 

I could be convinced either way. 

Because, again, I'm more interested in the NFT as a potentially beneficial technology than whether some NFT twitter millionaires legitimately own the images of the apes they bought or not.

Allahambra21,"&gt;It can be disentangled if it turns out that the image is a derivative work, or if someone obtains an NFT from someone else through fraud, or if there is some dispute over the interpretation and legality of the license, for example.

Okay so first off, no. None of that would disentangle the license from the work or from the token. 

Not to be blunt or rude, it just wouldnt.

If the image is a derivative work then there is no IP to protect and neither the NFT nor the license confers any kind of rights. (this is also, btw, neither unique nor exclusive to NFTs, its something that regularly happens with IP)

If someone obtains an NFT through fraud then its a fraud case, not an IP case. 

Same as if you are being sold a fake mona lisa with the IP rights attached that doesnt at all grant you any standing to claim the rights of the actual mona lisa. 

You've simply been defrauded. 

If there is a dispute about the effect of the license then there is a dispute of the effect of the license. 

That doesnt in any way disentangle the license agreement from the token or the work, it may at worst simply change the legal implication. 

&gt;In my opinion this is basically the central problem with the entire crypto industry: they have looked at finance and commerce and noticed it's very complicated and messy, and they think they can reinvent the economy to be much simpler and more clear-cut. But they haven't recognised that the main reason for all the complexity and messiness is because finance and commerce are attempts to abstract all kinds of complicated, messy, physical goods and processes.

I think you're looking at this from the wrong direction. 

NFTs werent created (as a technology) as a way to transfer IP rights, or sell/buy artwork or any other of the recently shilled use cases.

It was simply created as a thing, just because the creators thought it was a thing they could make. 

There wasnt some grand ""remake the art industry"" ambition behind it. 

All of this NFT art hype is just the most recent use that the technology has been applied too. Maybe it sticks, maybe it doesnt. Regardless I would be surprised if this usecase alone would be the last usecase that NFTs are applied too. 

Think of it more like a nail than a pre-purposed kit. Just because this particular nail just so happens to be used build GOP headquarters doesnt mean the purpose behind creating the nail in the first place was so that people can start building more GOP headquarters.

I would say wait and see what else people think up that the nail can be used for before discarding it in its entirety, rather than concluding that because the last building a nail was used for was to build a bad building, therefore all buildings built with nails will be bad. 

Also as I do outline in this particular little niche instance, the NFT *does* provide a small, slight, tiny, little benefit. 

It wont revolutionise the world, but it doesnt have to revolutionise the world in order to have made it just a slightly bit better. 

I dont think double sided tape is a massive improvement over regular tape, nor is it a massive thing all on its own. But I still think its better for it and the tiny little benefit it brings to exist than for it not to exist. 

See my point?

&gt;Where exactly is this ""significant streamlining""? Especially since most of the rights that are being sold are things that just... wouldn't have been sold outside the context of the NFT craze. Afaik people aren't optioning screenplays or signing record deals on OpenSea - they're selling rights to crappy, mass-produced digital cartoons, which in most cases the buyers probably won't do anything significant with. Prior to the NFT craze nobody wanted to buy these kinds of rights, no matter how easy or ""streamlined"" it would have been.",hr41d6w,t1_hr3f6r0,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr41d6w/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

\&gt;Why would a ticket seller put tickets on a blockchain? Don't give me that ""resellable"" BS argument because they can enable ticket resales much easier without a blockchain - they would just have to update their existing database/website to support this.

\- NFT tickets can be inscribed with exclusive art for say a kanye west concert. Which could then mean it could be worth something as its an exclusive collectors item from a once in a life time kanye west concert. 

\- Thanks to smart contracts, any revenue you gain from selling the ticket  to collectors can automatically pay the workers involved in the event. The security, the artist, the light guy, the cleaning guy, whatever. No middle man, just instant. You get a slice of the pie too of course. 

\- Thanks to the blockchain, companies can monitor the tickets (well, anyone can) and prevent scalping, fraudulent exchanges. Also thanks to the blockchain, people can very easily verify if a ticket is legit or not. 

\&gt;Putting my health information on a public blockchain? No thanks.

? what do you mean your health information is public? Why would it be public? Your medical passport's ownership will be public, people can see it belongs to you and you can verify that this medical passport is yours. People cant access the information within without YOUR permission, that's the plan at least. 

I dont know why you imply that its not secure having information on the blockchain. Blockchain is very secure to hacking. If people change information on one computer, it wont reflect on other computers within the blockchain. People can cross reference and know something's off. 

NFTs in healthcare has potential where your medical records can be updated and shared between you and medical personnels anywhere in the world. You can receive updates instantly, close communication loops and doctors can follow up with your case fairly quickly compared to traditional hospital communication. Why NFTs and blockchain? well why not? why invent a new thing when the technology already exists. Its universal, it already exists, the technology is secure and efficient as is. 

\&gt;What would anyone gain from this over what we have today? (Identity)

Self sovereign identity. Control over who you are online. Being able to verify who you are and verify your credentials and widely accepted across all corners of the digital world. Your identity is not controlled by the government or any other third parties. Any data of us online is owned by us and anyone who wants to get their hands on it need our permission.

Allahambra21,"&gt;Again, point out which part of the token refer to the license.

It doesnt, and I've never said that it does?

Why are you constantly attempting to twist my words into some kind of gotcha?

First the whole napkin/email agreement thing and now this weird attempt. 

Why dont you just charitably engage in the actual discussion instead of trying to wring out some technical gotcha by torturing my verbiage. 

&gt;The token doesn't even contain a hash of the license, so if that site goes down, you might still have a copy of that license elsewhere, but no easy means to prove it's authenticity.

Yes. Amazingly the project I've repeatedly said are far from optimal in its implementation isnt optimal in its implementation. Congratulations, you proved me wrong on something I've already ceded. 

The point being that while BAYC is improperly implemented the NFT does still provide the ability for those that properly do so. 

Additionally, but kind of beside the point, with the immutability of ethereum and with any simple cached version of the site it would be piss easy to prove the link between the license and the NFT. 

&gt;I'm sorry, but nope. The paragraph on commercial use could refer to ""commercial use"" in general (and make the whole ""ownership"" shebang useless, since it allows copying and derivative works), but it specifically refers to ""purchased art"", and it enumerates specific rights. Not the right to sublicense, for instance.

&gt;Vague formulation like ""you own the underlying Bored Ape, the Art, completely"" would get you slapped silly in your regular law school 101 class.

Christ me when did I claim that the BAYC creators where some gods of IP law. 

Yes its a shit written license but its very much a license that conveys (or at least does it best to convey) what I've been talking about. 

Again, I brought up BAYC to show the principle, not to hold them up as the exemplary. I'd ask you to stop pretending as if I did. 

**Edit: Also, after taking a second pass through the comment before posting it, its clear you have no clue what goes on in legal classes. It might surprise you to learn that when I was taught contract/agreement law we were presented with imperfect contracts and then asked to ""solve"" their outcomes. Not once would we be presented with the ""perfect contract"". (which also isnt a thing, but, again, besides the point)**

**""Vague formulations"", as you put it, is the bread and butter of contract law classes.**

&gt;""I'm aware"", ""first substantive point"" üëç

&gt;I believe you, Mr. IP Lawyer.

Great, this whole exchange would be a bit meaningless if you refused to buy into the premise and only decided to engage in order to try and dunk and gotcha on someone talking about something you've already made up your mind about. 

**Edit: Again a note from my second pass of the comment. I wont dox myself but I'd be more than willing to link you the university I attended and I could even share with you some class material I still have around on my microsoft cloud from back in contract law. If you can think of some way of doing so. Its in Swedish but I doubt that alone should prove an issue.**

&gt;NFTs, and potential DRM schemes using NFTs, are proprietary and rely on the trust of a third entity. We're arguing this literally on a post about OpenSea freezing specific NFTs, and delisting competing ""artwork"" based on questionably copyrightable originals.

Again, you are clearly not actually informed on how the technology works. 

Opensea is only able to ""blacklist"" NFTs in so far as they cant be displayed on their site. 

They still exist and are fully transferable and transactionable. 

There are plenty of decentralised marketplaces where blacklisting cant be done, it just so happens that Opensea had the first mover advantage and as such the greatest customer base. 

Should we solely talk about the concept of social media by only focusing on facebook?

&gt;I'm worked up, because shills pretend to be lawyers and give unsubstantiated and counterfactual technical and legal comments, while posing as a neutral third party.

&gt;For example:

Mate, I'm not even american so obviously my language will be a bit ""off"" and you somehow thought that licenses tied to NFTs must me tried in court before reaching a legal effect. 

And yet you still think youre suitable to judge whether someone is a legitimate jurist or not?

&gt;As a said, bullshit artists gonna bullshit.

&gt;Go ahead and fake my signature, or at least tell me how you'd go about it without breaking cryptography (which would break NFTs in the same way and allow anyone to transfer your tokens - and copyrights, I guess).

&gt;Signing with a random key and saying ""but I couldn't do this on the blockchain"" doesn't work either - blockchain by itself does not link keys to real world identities. You need external knowledge (vouched for by, e.g., OpenSea and Etherscan, and by transitivity by their sites' boring old digital certificates, lol) to know that 0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d is the real BAYC and not a fake.

I couldnt, because once again its not about single transaction situation. 

Now replicate your ability of cryptographical security for chained transactions while never requiring more than a simple press of a button for either party, and you may have a point.

The only proof of concept for such usability I've been shown has been under the stewardship of a centralised entity. Which, again, falls due to third party problem. Here is such a proof-of-concept explained: https://www.expensivity.com/how-non-fungible-tokens-work/

But I do get crypto currency, block chain, and NFTs.

Let me be clear: The Emperor Wears No Clothes

You aren‚Äôt missing anything. The more you understand the technology, the more you understand that it only serves two purposes: money laundering, and market manipulation scams.

Without typing out pages, let me try to put it as succinctly as possible:

-	People figured out that financial markets are highly regulated and hard to abuse
-	What if we create a proxy market based on anonymous(*) transactions? Decentralized so nobody can easily shut us down, anonymous so that nobody can come after us, and we make it exceedingly high tech so that well intentioned digital hippies will think it‚Äôs going to change the world
-	Now that we have an unregulated market, we can run every game in the book. People with much bigger pockets know that if nobody is watching over their shoulder, they can arbitrarily move the market wherever they want, profiting coming and going. This was a severe issue in the early days of Bitcoin, and is well documented but not as well as it should be.
-	Not only can we rig the markets, now we can move a lot of money across borders.

* cryptocurrency isn‚Äôt really anonymous for most people, but for criminals, it is

The only real ‚Äúvalue‚Äù that cryptocurrency actually brings to the table is facilitating criminal transactions. Outside of that it‚Äôs purely investment speculation. 

Think about that‚Ä¶the value backing the asset is essentially that it facilitates illegal transactions. It‚Äôs worth money because of the value it provides to organized crime. Nobody really acknowledges that in a direct way. People pretended for a few years that it was some sort libertarian utopia in the making, and that it would change finance forever. Then people realized the truth, pretended that they were suddenly becoming aware of the environmental impact, and pivoted into the current aimless game of hot potato that we see now. All these coins and tokens and not one problem solved, other than how to launder money and more easily scam people.",hr3w9c5,t1_hr2s5zc,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr3w9c5/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

NFTs are like the equivalent to if you went to every one of those secondary schools, took a picture of all that art, and tried to sell the pictures for tens of thousands of dollars. I'm specifically not getting into ""good"" or ""worthwhile"" art because it's a pointless discussion. What I'm saying is that fine art largely becomes fine art after the fact, it's not usually some random coming out of the gate with their first piece and selling it for $20 million.

The fine art world is realistically *incredibly* small. Literally two companies handle  the vast majority of high value art trades.

spanctimony,"So let‚Äôs go down that path for a second, because I agree, this is is the closest NFTs come to having a valid purpose.

Does that license then compel Sony to make that content available to you in perpetuity? 100 years from now if you want to download it, should you be able to? 

I think we all agree that‚Äôs a bit absurd, but where is the line drawn? 

Next question is, why on earth would Sony agree to such a thing? Right now, you can‚Äôt resell your digital goods at all! That sounds like things are just how they would like it.

Allahambra21,"&gt;Again, point out, where do I find that license? It's not in the token.

The token is just a token. It refers to an artwork and it is referred to by the license. 

You linked the license yourself.

Its intrinsically linked because each individual part is inseparable from the others and refers to each other. The website could take down the license from their site and that exact same license would still be the relevant license. The image host could go down an the token would still confer ownership over the art and its IP rights.

Again, its not revolutionary. All of this could be replicated in the physical world bar the fact that the NFT token itself cant be replicated or faked which a physical or other forms of digital proofs could be.

&gt;While you're at it, point out where's transferability defined in the actual license agreement at the BYAC site.

&gt;&gt;i. You Own the NFT. Each Bored Ape is an NFT on the Ethereum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Bored Ape, the Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Ethereum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Bored Ape.

I'm sorry but this is straying into regular law school 101 questions now. 

&gt;While you're at it, as an IP lawyer, tell me your opinion on the copyrightability of the original apes to begin with - AFAICT, they are mass generated procedurally, and copyrightability of such mechanical ""art"" is questionable, because it leads to all possible melodies being copyrighted since 2020.

First off they are not generated procedurally. Each individual part (x eyes, y mouth, z hat, etc) is handmade and thus covered by copyright and in combination they create new copyrights. Yes the ""new"" rights are much weaker than the inital rights but they still *are*. 

The issue (or one of them, rather) with procedural music is that the artists dont own the underlying compontents. The BAYC creators do own the underlying components for their works. 

Certainly it could happen that this is brought to court and ruled similarly to the procedural melody subject but that would then stray beyond what has been ruled on so far (to my knowledge). And that is always a risk with literally anything. 

&gt;And this point is related to my previous comment in this chain, and unanswered.

&gt;You do realize that digital signatures existed before blockchains, don't you?

&gt;I'm sure being an IP lawyer you'd be acquainted with the concept of DRM, and it does use cryptography for just this purpose.

&gt;Or I could write ""Permission is hereby granted to copy, display, sublicense etc."" and sign it with my digital certificate right here and now, like this.

Yes I'm aware of all this and frankly a bit upset that you knew too and didnt bring it up untill now since its about the first substantive point you've made. 

The issue with these is that they are proprietary (with all that entails), and rely on the trust of a third entity. And arguably they introduce additional commercial friction. But then its not as if NFTs are without commercial friction.

Thats literally it. 

Nothing major, nothing big, just that. 

As I said, NFTs arent revolutionary. They provide a *slight* benefit. That was always my observation and point, and it still holds true.

pitifulenergy,"&gt; They simply tie the artwork to a license that cant be disentangled

It can be disentangled if it turns out that the image is a derivative work, or if someone obtains an NFT from someone else through fraud, or if there is some dispute over the interpretation and legality of the license, for example. In my opinion this is basically the central problem with the entire crypto industry: they have looked at finance and commerce and noticed it's very complicated and messy, and they think they can reinvent the economy to be much simpler and more clear-cut. But they haven't recognised that the main reason for all the complexity and messiness is because finance and commerce are attempts to abstract all kinds of complicated, messy, physical goods and processes. The traditional ways in which we deal with problems such as inflation/deflation, fraud and plagiarism are far from perfect, but the crypto industry has simply tried to wish away these problems instead of making any attempt to deal with them. And as a result it's absolutely plagued with all of these problems.

&gt; Its not some massive revolutionary idea or application but it is a significant streamlining of a previously multi-step process. 

Where exactly is this ""significant streamlining""? Especially since most of the rights that are being sold are things that just... wouldn't have been sold outside the context of the NFT craze. Afaik people aren't optioning screenplays or signing record deals on OpenSea - they're selling rights to crappy, mass-produced digital cartoons, which in most cases the buyers probably won't do anything significant with. Prior to the NFT craze nobody wanted to buy these kinds of rights, no matter how easy or ""streamlined"" it would have been.

Also it should be pointed out that many NFTs don't come with any commercial rights to the underlying work, and that even if they do they can be limited in surprising ways (e.g. buying a Bored Ape NFT allegedly gives you the right to sell products with your particular ape image on them, but not the Bored Ape name or logo, and at least one company has fallen afoul of this already).",hr3f6r0,t1_hr2pnew,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr3f6r0/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

Allahambra21,"&gt;Spoiler: there isn't one. It's the one provided here. If that site's gone, you'd have a hard time proving that this token did grant you commercial use rights. Easier than for a napkin contract, but still.

Again, its intrinsically linked because the license refers to the transfer of the token, hence the transfer license is inherent. 

The token effectively functions as an IP certificate. Something which up to this point has been impossible to replicate for digital art and IP.

Except its even ""better"" than a traditional physical IP certificate because the NFT token cant be faked as long as the underlying blockchain remains. (which is a whole other discussion)

&gt;You've just claimed elsewhere that the medium doesn't matter for the contract, and a contract on a napkin would do.

&gt;Pick one or another.

I already explained this to you in response to another comment but sure, here it is again. 

The medium doesnt matter for the legal implication of an agreement. It can be an NFT, napkin, or a regular contract. 

The unique characteristic of NFTs isnt *legal* its *technological*. 

NFTs allow for the bundling of the work and the licence in a way that is functionally inseperable. 

Thats unprecedented. 

The legal implication of the NFT and the license is the same as a napkin and a commissioned artwork is. 

The benefit is that a napkin cant be made inseparable from a painting, an NFT artwork and its license can. 

*Thats* the difference. 

&gt;And also linking to that other comment of yours - you're just switching interchangeably between a specific NFT and what NFTs could do in general again.

Yeah and as I said in the other comment my whole point has always been about what NFT as a technology *can* do, and I've used BAYC as an example of a way to do it. 

Where BAYC fails but which the NFT still holds a sollution for cant be held against NFTs as its own thing, but a failure of this particular project.",hr3bjvv,t1_hr33oa8,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr3bjvv/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,
R_Sholes,"&gt; ""I've looked into BAYC and they bundle the transfer license with the artwork, which is only possible due to them using NFTs. Thats a slight leg up.""

And that was a lie, because I've looked at the BAYC token, and they contain no mentions of license, copyright, or transferability. So which specific NFTs are you talking about, again?

&gt; And if we instead then look at NFTs, specifically BAYC, well then the transaction is much simpler.

And if we look at BAYC, as I said, there's nothing in the token itself that even mentions the license or terms of use. You have to go to https://boredapeyachtclub.com/#/terms and read through it to make sure its actually viable.

For example, does that token sale from the commissioner to the second buyer actually involve selling the copyright?

Because while it states that ""you own the underlying Bored Ape, the Art, completely"", it also clarifies that you're only entitled to ""Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Yuga Labs LLC grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art"". Nothing about permission to sublicense or further transfer of ownership.

&gt; That cant be done with NFTs which have been constructed such that the licence and artwork is inseparable. 

And there we go again, BAYC = NFTs in general, until they don't.

Also, consider that the way ""NFTs bind the license and artwork"" is just a digital signature of the artwork's hash. Do you think digital signatures didn't exist until blockchains?",hr3bikc,t1_hr39569,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr3bikc/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,
Allahambra21,"&gt;The issues with NFT image sets selling commercial copyright to extremely similar images is a bug, though; the fact that minor derivations of the existing work may simply be a different commercially copyrighted entity is a downside to basically everybody.

Allahambra21,"&gt;Why are you're switching interchangably between ""NFTs"" and ""BAYC"", but only speak about commissioned art in general?

My original comment literally said nothing but: 

(paraphrasing) ""I've looked into BAYC and they bundle the transfer license with the artwork, which is only possible due to them using NFTs. Thats a slight leg up.""

My *original* comment made the differentiation between the two abudnantly clear. 

&gt;Again, NFTs don't have any inherent license. Even your beloved monkes don't. It's not some general talking point - you were the one talking about some ""inherent license"".

NFTs enable inherent licenses. 

That was the whole and **only** point. 

I said nothing more, nothing less. 

And its never been clearer that you're not actually engaging with this subject with an open mind when you paint me as some ""monkes lover"" eventhough I've already said I'm no fan of them. 

I mean christ friend, its some nerds on the internet inventing some niche thing that I from a legal perspective judge to provide a very very slight benefit. 

Why are you getting so heated over it. 

&gt;Someone had to discuss things with the original maker of the apes and chalk up the agreement. There was no ""inherent license"" just born out of sheer magic of blockchain.

If you'd want to commission some custom art, you'd still need to discuss that agreement, NFT or not. Sure, the platform can provide that agreement, but it doesn't have to use NFTs.

Yeah, no offence, but I suppose its clear now that the actual benefit I'm talking about flew past you. 

Yes, everything BAYC is doing with NFTs could quite simply be replicated by a simple license agreement on a commission website. I've never contested that and I've even recognised that in another comment in this thread. 

The benefit comes from the next chain of transfer.

The commissioner commissions artwork from an artist, this could be done the BAYC way or the regular commission way. There is no benefit there. 

But now the commissioner wants to sell the artwork again to a third party. The commissioner cant simply point to the license on the original commission website because the second buyer and the commission website wont be engaging in any exchange, the agreement is entirely and solely between the commissioner and the second buyer. 

To enable this purchase and reach the same legal finality as the license on the original website enabled the commissioner and the second buyer now have to engage in a legal negotiation. We can then assume the most charitable situation and say that they sommissioner simply linked the second buyer to the commission website and said ""lets use this same agreement"", to which the the second buyer agrees. Now thats simple enough except for the fact that they now, to ensure that this ""copied"" agreement would actually function, both have to read through the whole agreement to make sure its actually viable. If, for instance, the website agreement says ""WWW.Commissioning.com agrees to transfer all IP rights to the commissioner"", then the agreement is completely unapplicable to the purchasing and transfer between the commissioner and the second buyer. At which point the majority of the agreement can be kept by all the discrepancies have to be ironed out. 

And if we instead then look at NFTs, specifically BAYC, well then the transaction is much simpler. The commissioner (first buyer) puts up the token for sale or is approached by the second buyer. The second buyer ecxhange the money for the token and both the artwork and the IP rights, due to the transfer license being intrinsically linked to the token , are automatically transferred aswell. 

We've now succesfully turned what would be a minimum several conversations long discussion/negotiation with a minimum of some legal discussion, into a simple ""I will pay X for this, deal? Deal."" exchange. With the same legal finality. 

&gt;An IP lawyer acquaintance of mine have said:

&gt;&gt;And IP agreement could be written on a napkin.

&gt;&gt;The nature of the medium is irrelevant to the legal standing and implication of an agreement (or contract, in the napkin case).

&gt;So email correspondence with the site would be quite enough, I guess.

I'm sorry but this is nonsense in the context you've included it. 

From the perspective of legal implications then yes NFTs and Napkins or regular contracts are the same. 

The difference is that an NFT can be constructed such that the artwork and its license cant ever be separated. 

You cant do the same with other artwork. 

For example, theoretically you could sell a painting and write up the transfer license on a napkin and tape it to the back of the painting. But the napkin can simply be removed between the time the initial commissioner pays for the and the second buyer buys it from the commissioner. 

That cant be done with NFTs which have been constructed such that the licence and artwork is inseparable.

Allahambra21,"&gt;We'd absolutely hold that against commissioning as a practice if it was the standard way commissions were performed.

No offence but I think you're looking at commissioning with rose tinted glasses then. 

The vast majority of commissions (counting in numer of commissions, I would assume the same is true for aggregate price too but I'm not as certain) are low level artists infringing established copyrights (lot of anime, in the west, for instance). 

I would assume its not made as much of a deal about because partly most dont see an issue with some twitter artists selling a custom artwork for 50 bucks with mickey mouse in it, and partly because its not somehow tied to crypto to that particular crowd of contrarians havent been motivated to jump on it. 

&gt; A huge amount of the NFT ecosystem is comprised of these sort of randomly generated, barely differentiated image sets.

Yes from, about, this august that is definitely the case. 

But NFTs have been a thing since the better part of a decade and prior to this late summer this wasnt a common practice. 

So evidently it isnt some kind of inherent culture or practice to NFTs, its just the latest trend.

For the same reason it's fair to say NFT image sets generally have commercial copyright ownership baked in because that's the standard way of going about things, it's also fair to say that NFT image sets generally sell commercial copyright of very similar images to different people.",hr34u1l,t1_hr31dlg,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr34u1l/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

The agreement is external to the token. You can't say which rights are conferred just by looking at it.

Here's [the BAYC token](https://etherscan.io/token/0xea47b64e1bfccb773a0420247c0aa0a3c1d2e5c5). Care to point out which part says ""license is hereby granted"" et cetera?

There is a massive problem artists have with OpenSea and some other NFT sites recently that do not verify the identity of artworks being upload and the site refuse to take action or refund for sales of stolen works.

I'm just gonna repaste what I wrote below.

NFT is just a technology. 

""T-shirt printing"" doesnt ensure that every person putting a print on a t-shirt own the copyright to said print either. Which I can vouch for from walking the streets of barcelona and at every corner seeing a street peddler selling t-shirts with mickey mouse on it. 

Is this then a fault of ""t-shirt printing""? Should you and I take opposition to the technology of putting print on t-shirts because some people use it to breach copyright?

&gt;Most professional artists have TOS on their commission sheet that discuss what they're willing to do. Idk your personal experience but most artists I know are fine discussing terms if the work involve more complicated details. Obviously if you're looking for commercial works then I would suggest working with artists with more professional experiences than personal ones.

Thats great but I'm no millionaire and while I've engaged with both commercial and retail artists that are open for provision I think you underestimate the financial gate keeping preventing most regular people like me to commission from what you seem to deem ""professional artists"". 

No offence.

Why are you're switching interchangably between ""NFTs"" and ""BAYC"", but only speak about commissioned art in general?

Again, **NFTs** don't have any inherent license. Even your beloved monkes don't. It's not some general talking point - you were the one talking about some  ""inherent license"".

E.g, this is your point of contention:

&gt; Also, no offence, but having commissioned art in the past its not always super duper easy to discuss anything with the artist

Someone had to discuss things with the original maker of the apes and chalk up the agreement. There was no ""inherent license"" just born out of sheer magic of blockchain.

If you'd want to commission some custom art, you'd still need to discuss that agreement, NFT or not. Sure, the platform can provide that agreement, but it doesn't have to use NFTs.

An IP lawyer acquaintance of mine have said:

&gt; And IP agreement could be written on a napkin.

&gt; The nature of the medium is irrelevant to the legal standing and implication of an agreement (or contract, in the napkin case).

Allahambra21,"&gt;It's not an ""inherent license"". It's still an explicit agreement provided by the NFT platform. You could have the same prefilled explicit agreement provided on any art site, blockchain or not.

No, you're missunderstanding. 

The license isnt provided by any ""platform"" or website. Its intrinsically tied to the NFT token in particular. 

Yes you are right that any website could, theoretically, provide the same thing for any artwork sold on said website. 

But if the buyer of the artwork then want to seel the same art again, then the license on the original website would be irrelevant because the second prospective buyer and the original website wouldnt have any connection. There wouldnt be any link between them. 

The specific benefit I'm talking about here is that even after and NFT is transferred is the intrinstic license still tied to the artwork, because the NFT token enables this to be done. 

&gt;NFTs are just a record of transfers. They don't generally record what exactly is being transferred - this is something external, and you can't just assume you own any rights without checking the original agreement.

Again, not true. Blockchains are able to actually store data. Both License and artwork *could* be stored on-chain. 

But, importantly for this discussion, the artwork can simply be referred to while the transfer license is intrinstically held by the token.",hr31uul,t1_hr2unam,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr31uul/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,
Allahambra21,"&gt;See, the apes are procedurally generated, and can often differ on only a few minor traits, including expression and clothing. The fact everybody has a commercial copyright to their specific ape implies that others don't. But then there's a problem with derivative works; if I own Bored Ape #5013, a smiling green Ape, but want him to look angry, that might actually be Bored Ape #3101. Or it might get even more complicated; maybe Bored Ape #3101 has a different hat on, so my angry #5013 is actually one trait off both characters.

Yes there is definitely a risk here, but I want to point out that this isnt inherent to NFTs. 

Its an issue for BAYC because they're randomly generated and look so similar, not because of some inherent characteristic of NFTs. 

To bring it back to commissions. An artist could be commissioned to make and transfer the IP of several very similar creations, and this could present the same risk as you're describing above. But importantly we wouldnt hold that against commissioning as a practice.",hr30szd,t1_hr2t7k2,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr30szd/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

You dont need to teach an NFT law class for this, same as you dont need to teach an email law class in order to understand agreements made over email. 

Genuinely, this is like the weakest attempt at a gotcha I've ever seen. 

&gt;They don't have any inherent license. They might represent some parties agreeing to something (and I don't think this have been litigated for now), but that agreement may or may not include copyright transfer.

I'm specifically talking about BAYC (Apes), and they do. 

Also ""hasnt been litigated for now"" means nothing. It literally means nothing. 

Again, to take the same example, the first agreement made over email didnt have to be litigated for lawyers to confidently conclude that it would hold up as a legally binding agreement. 

There is nothing about NFTs or Blockchain that change the considerations of agreements or contracts. 

I dont know if this is some weird and widespread anti-NFT talking point because I've heard it a lot, and all I can say is that its just absolute nonsense. There is no substantive argument there. Its a handwaivey hope that a court will for some god forsaken reason decide to rule against all past precedence. 

Which is not exactly likely. 

Hate NFTs with all your hearts, I couldnt care less. But at least read up on the shit you're spewing to substantiate that hate. 

&gt;You might or might not have noticed (what with you being so busy studying for lawschool and practicing IP law) but a lot of NFTs are mired in controversy because they don't even ensure that the original minter owns the copyright to begin with.

NFT is just a technology. 

""T-shirt printing"" doesnt ensure that every person putting a print on a t-shirt own the copyright to said print either. Which I can vouch for from walking the streets of barcelona and at every corner seeing a street peddler selling t-shirts with mickey mouse on it.

While it's very difficult to draw a line, we all inherently recognize a distinction between ""art"" in the sense it uses technical creative skills and ""Art"" in the sense that it applies those skills towards some kind of purpose. The branding on my HP monitor is ""art"" in the former sense, but I think almost anybody would struggle to argue it's ""Art"" in the latter sense.

When NFTs talk about ownership ""like physical art"" and the future of artists, they're co-opting the language of ""Art"": creator-driven pieces, often that either try to say something or at least depict what the creator wanted to or how the creator wanted to depict it. Using that language to defend mass-producing random picrew avatars generated for sale, using those methods purely because they're the most utilitarian way to create a hierarchy of ape rarity, is still kind of weird. They're ""art"", sure, but I think as far as mass produced works go there's some intangible distinction between the ""Art"" of Warhol *choosing* to say ""boring modern conveniences like mass produced soup cans are great"" by mass producing soup can paintings and, like, just mass producing apes (or mass producing actual soup cans).",hr2y6hy,t1_hr2wi8k,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/ruykec/stolen_primate_nft_artworks_force_rloopring/hr2y6hy/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

Warhol painted soup cans to say something about modern culture; from what I recall, he was generally against abstraction.

Does a set of algorithmically generated NFT characters created to make money and to create an exclusive social club equally constitute art? Does it lack some required message or purpose beyond making money? Is it *unintentionally* art, by providing social commentary in the abstract about financialization?

F0RGERY,"Actually, NFTs are a modern expression of a Classical art style which first originated in Ancient Greece. While it has mostly been an underground movement, the community has evolved several times over the centuries, recreating and repurposing existing techniques for new depictions of raw emotion and impressions. Modern appreciators of the movement credit Samuel Thompson as being the frontrunner, though his works could be considered low brow, if not outright crude by today's standards. 

Since his time, while the movement has rarely been thrust into the greater artistic community, there have been dozens of amateur and even professional practitioners, from William Chaloner to C.L. Blood to Victor Lustig. One frequently underlooked amateur of the craft was Fernando Wood, who later became mayor of New York City and even a U.S. Congressman in his time.

NFTs are actually a great example of the movement's basis on how artists can convey emotions; They display confidence, vanity, opportunism, incredulity, and of course, innocence. NFTs are emblematic of a greater expression beyond simply their juvenile appearances, and it really takes some gifted talent to both appreciate their ability to sway people, and to draw ire and detraction from those who fail to understand the deeper meanings.

&gt; Real talk, tho: they're speaking about the internet from a business stand-point, I assume. Which...also doesn't make sense because before the dot com bust, people were crazy about putting shit on the web

Right - this doesn't make a lot of sense to me either. As one of the biggest business uses was payment processing that came around in '94ish or so? before then, you had to take credit card payments using carbon paper and submit the copies manually.

the vision and the idea was there.

i don't see a vision for NFTs that isn't tailored to speculation, gambling, money laundering, or grifting.

that also applies to crypto - bitcoin has been around for ~10 years and while it's valuation has spiked, what usefulness is there? i was around when bitcoin was super cheap, and i didn't buy into it then, but I thought it might have a future in porn - payment processors hate dealing with porn/porn sites (e.g. onlyfans drama re: pulling NSFW content due to pressure applied by...visa? i forget, and then abruptly reversing the decision.)

NFTs for art are useless, simple as that. You compare them to prints, except that practically nobody actually cares about ""unique"" prints. And the fact that they're not physical prints. They're JPEGs that are virtually indistinguishable from right-click, save as copies to the average person. It takes a hell of a lot more effort to duplicate a print than it does a JPEG, hence why someone might be interested in buying a print off someone else.

Gingevere,"&gt; The JPEG is not an NFT. The NFT is basically a Blockchain address that declares you as owner of a digital good, in some cases a JPEG which is something completely stupid, but it could be something like an asset of a game, for example characters, skins, weapons, or even the digital copy of the game. This would mean that you could resell the used digital game as you want and that steam could never revoke your license to use it. It could solve a ton of problems we currently have with microtransactions. It has a ton of potential and it would grant lot of power to the consumer.

SeamlessR,"An NFT can't be replicated. The thumbnail of your NFT can be copied. You aren't buying a picture and anyone telling you that you are is definitely scamming you. 

Saying you can copy an NFT is like saying I can take a picture of some painting and say ""look, here's this painting, $500,000 please"". 

If I had the actual real painting, certified by the people who do that shit, showed up with it at the place certified to do the thing by the people who do that shit, and then started bidding at half a million, because of all the certifications about it, I'd get my money. Because that money is verified as belonging to me as the verified owner of the verified painting. 

NFTs and blockchain stuff is automatic those verification services. Except not centralized, not backed, and still wild westing it up. So you can't trust someone telling you a thing represents a thing at all, because it doesn't represent whatever the picture is. However, it does represent something specific and nowhere else. Which means it can have a value unique to it, traded, tracked, so on. 

The part where scams and the crazy speculative market around it are working as well as they are is a demonstration that the core concept of tracking value and ownership works. 

But you own whatever the picture in the NFT is as much as you own a bridge I sell you. This much is true and I too am annoyed by people buying that as actually being able to own the bridge.

NFTs and the system for it is not about the art. Just like the value of the mona lisa is not about the art. There is value in fine art beyond its capacity to launder money obviously, but the thing that makes it valuable for laundering money happens to be the unique identifiable nature of it. 

The literal only purpose of an NFT is to be unique and identifiable. Which the system that provides that does well enough that money laundering previously only seen on the scale of fine art and antiquities scams can now be done digitally. 

With the same kind of security the physical art brought by way of being traceable, identifiable, and unique.

itisSycla,"The best analogy for NFTs i have came across is that they are the same as those companies that allow you to pay to name a star, or to buy a square meter of land in scotland that comes with a certificate that states you are a lord because of it.

In both cases, you just pay a company to agree with you. The star isn't named after your girlfriend because no one with authority in the field recognizes that random company as having any sau in the matter, and you are not a lord because no institution recognizes that other random company as having any authority to decide who is part of the nobility and who isn't.

ReveilledSA,"&gt;Firstly, that's why I specified ""for an exact copy"".

A print of the Mona Lisa would not be an exact copy.

&gt;Secondly, you failed to address the core point which is why anyone should care which Mona Lisa is the ""original"". Hopefully that is because you realized there is no more reason than anyone should care who owns an NFT.

I didn't address it because it's not relevant.  The story I'm relating is of a person who argued that an NFT-associated copy of a digital file was a special, higher form of art versus a non-NFT copy, and they compared detractors of this idea to someone who would argue that a print of the Mona Lisa has exactly the same artistic value as the original.  Note, not ""an exact copy of the original"", a *print*.

But, for the sake of argument, why should anyone care which Mona Lisa is the original? Personally, I don't, much.  But putting myself in the shoes of someone who does, I'd say that humans find value in things which are first.  We celebrate the people who were first to the poles, first to the moon, some of us treasure the first music album they ever bought. So when it comes to the Mona Lisa, we might similarly treasure the one which was painted first.  Beyond that, there's an element of connection.  We like to share experiences with others, particularly people who are important to us. Many people are inspired by and place great importance on individuals long dead.  Leonardo da Vinci is one of those people, and when you view the Mona Lisa, you see the same painting that Leonardo saw.  You see the brush strokes he made.  You feel the weight of centuries that seperate you, and in a tiny way, bridge that gap, if only for a moment.  This object you are viewing was once in *his* workshop, being touched by *his* brushes, being painted by *his* hands.

I don't personally feel that way about the Mona Lisa, but if someone cited those reasons as to why they'd consider the original more valuable to them than a copy, I could understand their viewpoint.  Neither of those apply uniquely to NFTs, since the NFT copy won't be the first copy, and there's nothing about the NFT version that gives it a more authentic human connection than any of the other identical copies.",hoy7ft2,t1_hoxzyz6,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rienpv/phil_spencer_says_that_they_will_not_add/hoy7ft2/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

NFTs are the stupidest, most infuriating garbage I have ever seen. I thought blockchain evangelism was annoying as people kept trying to force blockchain into situations that did not need them, or try to solve some problem that was already answered.

NFTs, and crypto currencies, aren't really art or currencies, respectively, they're unregulated securities and investments. They're about suckering more people so a smaller group of people can get rich. Yeah you can buy things with bitcoin and etherium but why would you do that when the price is supposed to continue to climb, and then you can cash? And NFTs give their owners exactly 0 legal protection or rights. You do not own that picture, you just paid for a receipt.


Blockchain has some real value in niche situations, but it's been co opted as a get rich quick scam, with some crazed techno-utopian pipe dream that can't ever be realized. All the while consuming more energy that literal fucking countries.

I still have yet to hear someone actually explain a practical use for NFTs. I was trying to think of one and maybe if like, there could be completely unique Pokemon or something that you could get in the endgame, and that's a way to ensure it can't be duplicated?

PresN,"But see, even in your example the ""solution"" doesn't match the ""problem"". Sure, the blockchain can hold an immutable record that the Yangshan Port Authority inspected the cargo. Lets say that there's no way to fake it- 100% this cargo got an inspection sticker by the YPA, and not some 3rd party.

100% the San Fransisco Port Authority will still inspect it. Why? Because it doesn't matter that there's a cryptographically-signed sticker from the YPA on it: the _inspection record_ isn't the _inspection_, and if the SFPA was willing to blindly trust that the YPA was inspecting things and they didn't need to double-check, then they wouldn't need to do it now either. It doesn't matter _how_ the YPA promises they inspected the cargo, via blockchain or paper ledger, you would still have to _trust_ that they _actually did it_. Blockchain adds nothing. And if they _did_ trust each other... why would you need to use the blockchain? Just use a regular database and disallow edits.

And oh look, we see the same thing with NFTs! It doesn't matter that the NFT is immutable and we can track ownership of it, it has _jack all_ to do with ownership, via IP or copyright or anything else, of the _actual artwork_.

painter-according,"&gt; Fractionalized asset ownership of things like buildings and houses.

That's called a ""timeshare"". They've existed for decades, and they're stupid.

&gt; The next generation stock market will be on the blockchain and shares will be NFT‚Äôs.

Why?

&gt; Fractionalized ownership of sports teams

Not only have publicly traded sports teams existed for many years (you could buy shares in Man United in 1892), but the crypto industry has already reinvented publicly traded companies once before. They were called ICOs, and they were complete nonsense.

&gt;  or music rights

As in, you want people to be able to buy 1% of the copyright of a song? That sounds stupid and pointless, but I'm pretty sure it's achievable already. You could just set up a company that owns the rights to the song and nothing else, and sell shares in that company.

&gt; The next generation of account security could involve NFT‚Äôs.

How and why?

&gt; Plenty more that I haven‚Äôt mentioned and plenty more that haven‚Äôt even been thought about yet.

If you could give us just one serious example, with an actual rationale for why it would be good and why it needs to involve NFTs, you wouldn't need to gesture vaguely at things that people might think up in the future.

&gt; Point is potential real use cases are everywhere. We‚Äôre just not there yet.

None of these ideas sound like they would be especially complicated to develop, and NFTs have been around for over seven years now. People have managed to develop all kinds of NFT scams and trading platforms. Why has nobody managed to do *anything* worthwhile with them yet?

&gt; The future is on the blockchain.

There is more than one blockchain, and all they are is an especially dumb database system. The idea that our entire society is going to be based around them is incredibly farfetched. Even if they are widely adopted (which I think is unlikely), they're just going to be an obscure building block for other technologies. Conventional databases have been widely adopted and are very important, but if someone 50 years ago had said ""the future is on the database"", we would think that was ridiculously pompous and over-the-top even with hindsight.

&gt; Companies are rapidly adopting that.

Not really. Also, business often makes extremely stupid decisions. Companies rapidly adopted leaded fuel, even though everyone had a pretty good idea how dangerous it was and better options were available. All they care about is their own profits, even if that means scamming or killing people.

&gt; And NFT‚Äôs will play a major role in the metaverse and real life.

lool-g-lool,"The point is the signature. So, in the real world, you would sign or somehow denote that you own made that art - a physical signature or in the case of more notable works, the physical materials you used to make the painting, whatever can indicate that it is the original. In the digital world, NTF creators would hope it would be the NFT - you create a digital masterpiece, and you ‚Äúmint‚Äù it as an NFT. Now go collect your millions of eth!

Only, of course it isn‚Äôt that simple. Just as when you sell your own art in the real world, you have to find a buyer. When you find a buyer, the buyer will want to know that what you have is authentic, which is where this signature or minting comes into play. You painted the painting and included your signature along with the number of prints and what numbered print that one is. In the case of digital works, you would verify it cryptography as belonging to you.

But why would anyone want this stupid shit? It‚Äôs art. Go ask the art world. From my understanding, it has to do with money. Someone buys an original andy warhol painting, collects more, exhibits them, increasing popularity, increasing value, someone buys original, seller profits. Same thing with selling NFTs, I would imagine.

But why can‚Äôt I just sell the right clicked images? You can, because people will buy anything. This doesn‚Äôt mean that the buyers with the big bucks aren‚Äôt going to be more careful with regards to verifying authenticity.

I think theres a chance you're misunderstanding how an nft is structured. Its not based on a host or a company to hold it up. Its a decentralized system. You dont need to verify the nft after an update because its just all still there. Its a bit like saying if you log out of your email all your emails disappear.


It is not simple to copy your original nft. I'm not sure where you're getting this idea from. NFT stands for non-fungible token. Non-fungible literally means it is unique.


If I write 8384 on a sheet of paper and hand it to you. And you take a new sheet of paper and write 8384 on it and hand it back to me. Did I get the same thing back? No, I got a different unique sheet of paper with the same number on it.


If I again write the same thing down and hand it to you, you now have 2 unique things. You cant duplicate an nft. Because the copy you make isnt the NFT, it is a new thing, but it doesnt have the history of the original. And the history is part of what keeps it unique.


A ton of this stuff is open source. Its not about keeping secrets from people in the code. Most of these systems run openly. I get that some people dont like nfts and crypto and such, but there is a reason for it to exist and persist for so long even if its all a scam.

How do you think those places get tracked when they have VPNs up the asshole and servers all over the world that can be up and running within moments of a shutdown? You'd think that would be difficult to track and it somewhat is, but at the end of the day every single thing you do on your computer leaves a paper trail. So NFTs don't even add anything here. Also once the host server does go down, or the codec needs to be updated it's worthless. Like imagine for a second it was created using Adobe Flash, but Adobe flash went down recently, it's totally gone. How do you verify your NFT now? Well you can't, there'll be no host to verify against. So now you need a new code and a new identifier, however due to the nature of the system, your new NFT will technically never be the first one you had, so you'll never have what you paid for in the first place ever again. It's also simply just a copy of your original NFT. Imagine if multiple people pick up the code before then, as in it goes open source, which is constantly pushed as a positive in these arguments.

But also I think there will end up being a place for crypto -&gt; nfts -&gt; whatevers next in this arena.

WelcomeToTheFish,I honestly want someone to explain to me how NFTs are useful. How is it useful for anything other than a money laundering scheme?,hojde37,t3_rfq4my,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rfq4my/keanu_reeves_laughs_out_loud_at_a_man_trying_to/hojde37/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,
Superboy309,"Because you cannot reasonably sell Bitcoin for more than the market price of bitcoin, of buy them for less than the market price. The NFT provides an asset that you can artificially inflate, independent of any market, since it's unique. If you have 100 Bitcoin sitting in a wallet that's linked to ransomware and 1 Bitcoin that you've purchased with clean money, you have no way of moving that 100 Bitcoin directly to the clean wallet without it still being known as dirty. Instead, you spend the 1 Bitcoin on an NFT, which is a clean purchase, and then a month later ""random person"" (the dirty account) comes by and wants to purchase your NFT for 100x what you paid for it. Now you have 100 Bitcoin in your wallet and, if you hid your ownership of the dirty wallet well enough, it's ""clean"".

You can make this process even more powerful by, for example having the dirty account buy a bunch of cheaper, related NFTs from actual random people, and then make sure you are the one that holds the most expensive one on your clean account, so that it is sensible for the dirty account to buy it for a huge markup.",hojd07v,t1_hogjez3,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rfq4my/keanu_reeves_laughs_out_loud_at_a_man_trying_to/hojd07v/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,
TheBeckofKevin,"I guess so, if you think about a bit of a bigger picture I don't believe it will end up being useless. Do I think it currently exists in a way that is super helpful? No, absolutely not. Its basically just an experiment, its an expression of being able to do something with less of a concrete reason for why doing that thing is beneficial to humans or society or life or whatever.


Consider how much of our lives is about ownership. Things, as in real life tangible objects all are almost defined by which person or group of people they belong to. . Your shoes. Your shirt. Your house. Their building. Its pretty easy to see how important ownership of an object is.


Next think about how the internet started. Suuuper basic file sharing. Sending essentially text to another computer that was attached with a wire. Adding more computers. Adding faster hardware. New ideas start to form, websites start to exist, and the world wide web is sort of born. Its brought into society and becomes available and easy for people to use it as a tool. Sweet. I'd say somewhere in like 1998 people were like, ""this is what the internet is."" Chatrooms, basic websites, slow data retrieval from other places. A crappy encyclopedia.


But then google 'fixes' how searching is done, myspace comes along and sort of becomes the standard for how you intermingle your online self with your true identity. Amazon becomes a 'place' to shop. It was super weird. People didnt want to put all their data on the internet. Then facebook comes out and becomes even more of a big thing. Youtube shows whats possible with faster and more reliable streaming. Then netflix replaces cable for a lot of people etc etc. The thing is its always evolving and its still evolving.


So what I'd say is that while I dont know what or why nft's are useful for yet, I'd be very hesitant to say ""They dont serve a purpose."" Because ownership is very important to our lives, and the internet is continuing to grow and dominate more and more of our attention and resources.


For instance, lets say the stock market. It is a bunch of shares of companies in a digital format. We trust banks to be getting those stocks when we buy them. We assume that when you buy a share of a stock on fidelity that they are going out and buying a share of that company and holding it for you. Well what if they could prove it. A company could sell shares of their company by having 1000 NFTs that they sell. The data is just 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, for each one. However, the NFT itself is what you want to own as that represents the share of the company. If you buy that NFT you own that share. There is no way to dispute it because all 1000 are verifiable without needing to trust anyone. Granted this is just an idea where ownership is sort of the important part, and the data itself is not as important. Perhaps in the future more and more elements of stocks and finance follow nft workflows.


I dont know. But thats the point. Its really really hard to predict how a technology will evolve and where it will find a place of purpose (or even if it will).


Are all the crypto bros and startups with nft in their names right? No, more than likely they're cashing in early and making as much as they can as fast as possible, but will nfts find their place of real purpose beyond digital scams and trading cards? I think its very possible. People want to own things, and those things are more and more digital as time goes on. Obviously there needs to be an understanding of what the nft actually is and over time I think we'll move away from the URL nfts and so on and more into data that is somewhat relevant or even completely irrelevant and the NFT themselves become the true value. Similar (but different) to how bitcoin or other crypto currencies 'have value.'",hojctfb,t1_hohf25h,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rfq4my/keanu_reeves_laughs_out_loud_at_a_man_trying_to/hojctfb/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,
millhammer29,"What? showing an example of something like a skin doesn't invalidate anything else and it does not mean I swap what I'm talking about to make a point  it is all relative and connected to NFTs. I will say, technology tends to make fools of those who say 'never' and leave it at that for that point. NFT skins is an example of something that could be found in NFT gaming.

If you don't think people making a living blockchain gaming is a good thing then I don't see a need to continue this we won't see eye-to-eye and internet arguing never goes anywhere.

I do not appreciate the light you are trying to paint me in. NFT discussions are very nuanced in general so naturally there are a few different ways to take a conversation. it is not ""swapping what were talking about at the drop of a hat"" just in most peoples experience talking about nfts they solely think its those dumb jpegs.

Yes digital signatures are a mechanism which has existed without blockhain technology. NFTs use digital signatures *combined with* a digital marketplace to operate. The digital marketplace allows transfer of ownership using public and private keys. Why is that important?

Everybody wants this current version of NFTs so all the people saying ‚ÄúNo, no, it‚Äôll be better later‚Äù no, it won‚Äôt, because your ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù crap has just been taken over my corporations who will do whatever they want. Hence, current NFTs.

They like to ‚Äúdecentralize‚Äù shit from the government, then get confused when they‚Äôve created a digital ancap. Literally none of them can even tell you the actual benefits of their buzzwords. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs decentralized!‚Äù Yeah, cool, I know that, but do YOU actually know what that means? It‚Äôs not some automatic win just because ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not backed by any real life entity! Good for us!‚Äù They also can‚Äôt tell you why NFTs are needed, since you can say ‚ÄúBut we can already do that‚Äù to every argument they have. 

I could sell you a REAL picture, that you would really only the only unique copy of.

Njaa,"Yes, while I'm not necessarily advocating for this implementation, I think your understanding of what you COULD do with NFTs is correct.

I would rather make the comparison to music sales. Let's say you buy the new Taylor Swift album as a tokenized NFT, and she enters contracts with all the major streaming services that says anyone who holds an album NFT has the right to play the music and any music videos without commercials or other charges. Maybe they even get access to bonus tracks or whatever. 

This would break down the walled gardens that each streaming service builds around themselves - freeing up users to select the application whose functionality serves them best, without having to consider their purchase history. 

Someone forging this type of NFT wouldn't reap any of the benefits. They would just have a dead forgery, as none of the streaming services would respect it.",hoirtyp,t1_hohx72p,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rfq4my/keanu_reeves_laughs_out_loud_at_a_man_trying_to/hoirtyp/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

Kazizui,"&gt; I'm done wasting my time with you. You're just another defeatist corporate shill. I have never traded a used digital item to another person, so you're just talking out your fuckin ass. 

Lol, just like you can't distinguish tech problems from non-tech problems, you also can't distinguish personal bias from basic logic.

As a consumer I personally would prefer having the option to sell digital goods, even though I don't regard it as particularly important. Hell, like most people the whole concept of digital ownership is pretty unimportant - which is why streaming services have already conquered music and movies, and will soon conquer videogames as well. But it isn't going to happen, because the people that would have to implement the change are motivated not to. 

&gt; A ""trade fee"" is better than a loss on a pirated copy.

Again, you are ignoring reality. This is already the case right now - publishers could drop the price of games to a couple of bucks, take a tiny fee as a result, and basically eliminate piracy overnight. But they don't, because their preferred route is to use DRM.

Again, everything you're proposing as an NFT benefit _could_ be implemented right now, today, without NFTs. The reason it doesn't happen is because the creators don't want to, and consumers don't care enough to force it. Inventing some new mechanism to implement something that nobody wants does not automatically mean it's going to happen.

Third, fortune 500 companies are actively investigating how they can apply NFTs to their business model. For industry, supply chain tracking and authentication are a big example. So I'm not sure why you think there are no valid use cases.

This has happened multiple times historically where a bank or credit card agency pulls the rug from under them for PR reasons.

It's also not about selling exclusive shows per se, it's about being able to raise capital in a decentralized way, while providing a certain degree of confidence to the stakeholders through the smart contract.

Of course the existing industry doesn't benefit from this. Why would publishers and aggregators want talent to be able to do their own ventures without their infrastructure?

It would obviously not mean the end of the current system, just like self publishing books didn't kill all the publishing houses, but it would disrubt the industry quite a bit and empower individuals to do their own thing, even if they end up still working in a hybrid model.

For example, you could raise funds to go shoot a video in some exotic location. Token holders get early access to the material and a small percentage of the revenue generated by that video, which means they would actually act as investors on something they wanted to consume anyway.

Suddenly, you don't need to take the risk of spending that money out of pocket or having to rely on any specific investor that may take a larger cut because of the inherent risk.

This doesn't just apply to porn, music artists could record and publish their albums with much more preferable terms than what labels currently take, etc.

My point is, that there are some real, potential upsides to the technology, but right now people are only using it to launder money and scam folks by pumping their own NFT prices and then selling them to dupes at a ""discount"".

To me its like the technology is neat and has some applications, but it's not what evangelists say it is, nor is it as useless as detractors claim.

It's like soap, you know? It definitely doesn't cure or prevent all diseases, but it's neat to have soap.

Kazizui,"&gt; The candle makers of the days of old didn't want the light bulb to be invented either. And yet, your home is lit by bulb and not candle.

Stupid argument is stupid. The light bulb was a brand new invention. Selling second-hand games is not. We already _had_ the ability to sell games, and game publishers gradually eroded that ability. Turns out people really don't care very much about it at all. 

&gt; The first time someone trades a copy of a used digital game to someone else, it's game over for the current way the market works, whether EA fuckin likes it or not.

Absolute nonsense. Nobody cares. We had the ability to sell games, and we gave it up. It's not important enough to change anything.

&gt; Besides, your ignorance of the subject is totally showing, because NFTs can easily be monetized. Any time a transaction would occur, fees will be paid. [Insert company here] can easily charge a small fee any time their copyrighted work is transfered.

Why charge a small fee when they can make a much larger cut by selling another copy? This is immensly stupid logic.

R_Sholes,"""This doesn't exist -&gt; That's because it needs crypto!"" is a bit of a logic leap, don't you think? Especially if you're failing to even identify the original problem. E.g, from previous poster's comment:

&gt; It is safer than current implementations such as just using your phone to hold your ticket.

Safer against *what*? E-ticket forgery and phishing for tickets aren't common threats. Ticket resale/scalping is the actual problem, and NFTs don't help here.

In case of title insurance, having a digital signature on the blockchain doesn't do anything more than having a digitally signed title without a blockchain - NFT still doesn't record that there are, e.g., pending lawsuits or potential heirs.

Since the original NFTs has to come from someone who has the authority to grant those titles, and since you don't want property sale to be as simple as a cash transaction, you're not getting rid of the middlemen either.",hoil6a1,t1_hoi6far,/r/SubredditDrama/comments/rfq4my/keanu_reeves_laughs_out_loud_at_a_man_trying_to/hoil6a1/,1,SubredditDrama,t5_2ss5b,r/SubredditDrama,0,,,

Cryptocurrency is used all the time, because being able to bypass normal payment systems and/or launder money is insanely useful. But NFTs aren't like that.

Every idea you've given would work just as well with a non-blockchain solution, while also being cheaper since you're not dealing with enormous transaction fees. If a camgirl wants to sell exclusive shows, she can just... sell exclusive shows?

Every time this hypothetical token trades hands on the secondary market, she's missing out on potential direct sales. If the token goes down in price, then it's directly undercutting her value. If it goes up in price, then she could have just sold tickets for a higher price to begin with, since fans are clearly willing to pay. If the token is being traded often enough that the hypothetical commission is earning her money, that just tells us there's clearly enough demand to sell tickets at that price for every show instead.
